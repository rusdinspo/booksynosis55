He&#x2019;s back to drinking, he&#x2019;s not talking to his father, the LAPD Special Projects Department continues to shadow him, and the memory of a woman named Mai haunts him day and night.<br><br>And while Jacob has tried to build a bridge to his mother, she remains a stranger to him, imprisoned inside her own tattered mind.<br><br>Then he comes across the file for a gruesome unsolved murder that brings the two halves of his life into startling collision. <br>Finding the killer will take him halfway around the world, to Paris&#x2014;the city of romance, but also of gritty streets, behind the lights.

But in <i><i>The Golem of Paris</i></i>, he and Jesse Kellerman raise that suspense to a whole new level.</p><p><b>Jonathan Kellerman</b> is one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors, with more than three dozen <i><i>New York Times</i></i>&#x2013;bestselling crime novels, most recently <i><i>Motive</i> </i>and <i><i>The Murderer&#x2019;s Daughter</i></i>.

How else to sleep in this deranged place, its nights clotted with moans and prayers to a God that does not exist, cannot exist, for the<br> State has declared him dead. <br> The State is correct. <br> Proof of God&#x2019;s death is all around her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senseless, trying to hide. She cowers just the same as the Russian kneels to unlock her cage, his greatcoat opening like a pair of dark wings. The cell door stands ajar, admitting a sickly fan of light from the grease-smeared bulb that smolders in the corridor. <br> &#x201c;The patient will stand, please.&#x201d;<br> She will be punished. Her cellmates want none of it. Fat Irena pretends to snore, blowing white balloons. Olga&#x2019;s fingers are knotted in the hollow of her belly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth bed is empty.<br> &#x201c;Little bird,&#x201d; the Russian says. &#x201c;Do not make me ask again.&#x201d;<br> She swings her feet to the freezing concrete, finds her paper slippers.<br> They step into the low, broad passageway known as <i>Bulv�r &#x161;�lenci.</i><br> Lunatics&#x2019; Boulevard.<br> While the Russian finds the correct key, she assumes the mandatory posture, kneeling with forehead to the linoleum. Along the corridor, a feverish racket is stirring. The other inmates have heard jangling. They want to know. Who is leaving? Why? <br> &#x201c;The patient may stand.&#x201d;<br> She rises, using the wall for support.<br> He leads her down the Boulevard, past the staff room, where orderlies doze in armchairs under heavy doses of self-prescribed sedatives. Past physicians&#x2019; offices, exam rooms, Hydrotherapy and Electroshock and rooms unmarked except for numbers. Rooms that cannot be labeled truthfully.<br> The women&#x2019;s ward ends at two consecutive locked doors, gray paint peeling to reveal steel the same color.<br> Where is he taking her?<br> Syringes crunch beneath his boot-heels in the dank stairwell, the temperature dropping with every step. Upon reaching the ground floor, the Russian pauses to remove his greatcoat and drape it over her shoulders. The hem puddles. He places his <i>ushanka</i> on her head, ties the flaps under her chin. <br> &#x201c;I would give you my shoes,&#x201d; he says, tugging off his gloves, &#x201c;but I must drive.&#x201d;<br> He pauses, frowns at her. &#x201c;Are you all right, little bird? You look unwell.&#x201d;<br> Bare fingers brush her cheek. The sudden warmth causes the cold to constrict around her viciously, and she recoils, shivering.<br> He withdraws his hand. &#x201c;Forgive me.&#x201d; <br> He looks almost remorseful, twisting the thick black ring on his index finger. &#x201c;Do not be afraid. You are leaving this place.&#x201d; He offers the gloves. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br> She steps out of the paper slippers and pulls the gloves on over her numb feet. They cover her to the ankles.<br> He laughs. &#x201c;Like a chimpanzee.&#x201d;<br> She smiles obligingly.<br> They step out into the frigid courtyard.<br> The guard manning the hospital gate wears a Socialist Union of Youth pin his lapel. The Russian returns his salute and says that the patient Marie Laskov� has been remanded into his custody.<br> A riffle of paperwork, a signature, a second exchange of salutes.<br> And like that, she is cured, no longer a menace to society, but a healthy, sane, productive citizen of the republic. <br> The guard unlocks the gate and shoves it wide.<br> &#x201c;Ladies first,&#x201d; the Russian says. <br> It&#x2019;s there, three steps away: freedom. Yet she does not move, gazing back across the courtyard, a brown scalloped mass. The snow of St. Catherine&#x2019;s Day, well on its way to Christmas mud. A single locust tree stands denuded, its branches pruned back to thwart escapees, the trunk wrapped in barbed wire for good measure. <br> The Russian watches her patiently. He seems to understand what she is doing before she understands it herself.<br> She is counting.<br> The rows of windows, chiseled through concrete.<br> The ravaged faces beyond. The afflicted bodies. The hunger and the thirst, the cold and the heat and the squalor. The names. <br> She is counting them all, inscribing them in the ledger of her mind.<br> She must bear witness.<br> &#x201c;Come, little bird. We should not keep him waiting. I left the car running.&#x201d;<br> She asks who <i>he</i> is.<br> The Russian raises his eyebrows, as though the answer should be self-evident.<br> &#x201c;Your son.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She turns the corner, moving fast as she can in her gloved feet. <br> <i>I&#x2019;m coming, Danek</i>. <br> But the car draws her up short: a Tatra 603, squat, matte black, tailpipe stuttering exhaust, identical to the car that brought her in for interrogation so many lifetimes ago. <br> Who knows? It may be the<i> </i>very one.<br> They came to her door one afternoon, a pair of men with cement eyes<i>.</i><br> <i>Inspector Hrub� requests that you accompany us.</i><br> So polite! You couldn&#x2019;t possibly say no.<br> She didn&#x2019;t worry. She didn&#x2019;t even bother to send Daniel next door, confident she&#x2019;d be home in time to cook dinner. And what a dinner it would be: she had half a package of lasagne noodles. Not the gray Russian kind that boiled for hours without dissolving, but authentic, a little Italian flag on the box. Daniel was delirious with anticipation. When she went to the kitchen for her coat, he was eating them straight out of the box, crunching brittle planks between his teeth and giggling. She smacked his hand and stuck the box up on a high shelf, telling him she&#x2019;d be back soon and don&#x2019;t be a pig.<br> Downstairs, she got into the Tatra and spoke the name of her contact. She knew what to expect. For the sake of appearances, they would take her to the StB headquarters on<b> </b>Bartolom&#x11b;jsk� Street. Confirmation would require a phone call. They would let her go without apology or explanation, and she would board the tram back to her apartment. As they pulled into traffic, she sat back, preoccupied foremost with how to make a decent filling for the pasta without butter, cheese, oil, or tomatoes.<br> Now she sees the car, maybe the same car, and her bowels clench. It&#x2019;s a hoax, another ingenious ploy to grind down her will and pulverize her spirit.<br> The tinted back window drops in jerks.<br> &#x201c;<i>Matka</i>.&#x201d;<br> The voice is impossible. The face, too. She left a laughing six-year-old and has returned to a sober little judge. Lank brown hair tumbles down his forehead. He is not smiling. He looks as though he has never smiled in his life. <br> &#x201c;Why are you waiting,&#x201d; he says.<br> Why, indeed. Cheeks streaming, she waddles forth, climbs into the back seat.<br> And immediately he shrinks from her, pressing into the opposite door, his nose scrunched. She must stink. She takes his face in her hands and smothers it in kisses. Still he won&#x2019;t look at her, his eyes bent toward the ceiling. She says his name; kisses him, again and again, until he forcibly pulls away, and she falls back, her throat salty and raw.<br> The Russian gets behind the wheel. He tries to shift into gear and stalls out.<br> &#x201c;Garbage,&#x201d; he mutters. Of all his cold-weather clothing, he has chosen to retain his scarf, and he pinches the fringe annoyedly, struggling to restart the motor. &#x201c;You people don&#x2019;t know the first thing about making cars.&#x201d;<br> She says Daniel&#x2019;s name again, softly.<br> He sits with his body twisted away from her, glaring at the fists in his lap.<br> &#x201c;Mercedes-Benz,&#x201d; the Russian says. &#x201c;Now that is a car.&#x201d;<br> <i>I thought I would be back for dinner, Danek. I thought we would eat lasagne. </i><br> It&#x2019;s too painful to look at the back of her son&#x2019;s head, so she wipes her wet face, tells her heart to hold its tongue. The Russian manages to get the engine going and the Tatra plods along through Prague 8, toward Hole&#x161;ovice.<br> She supposes she&#x2019;ll know their destination soon enough. Just as she did not question the men who came to her door, she does not question this new turn of fate. More often than not, the system takes away. Moments of generosity are not to be analyzed, but grabbed and hoarded like the boxes of Cuban oranges that appear in the shop windows without warning.<br> You buy as many as you can afford, as many as you can carry, because you cannot know when they might appear again, if ever. You take more oranges than two people can possibly eat; you barter them for items you do need, toilet paper or socks; if you are enterprising, you swap some of the oranges for sugar, which you then use to make a loose marmalade of the remaining oranges. You keep the jars hidden in the bureau like golden coins, ready to be deployed in lieu of cash when noodles come along. <br> <i>But Miss Laskov� </i>Inspector Hrub� said, turning a jar in his hand. <i>I must object: you made it far too sweet, you eliminated the bitter edge, which is makes a good marmalade. Tell me, who would want such sweet marmalade? </i><br> He set the jar down, pushed a pencil toward her<i>. Write down their names</i>.<br> Now the Tatra reaches the &#x10c;ech&#x16f;v Bridge, iced over, its statuary in disrepair. Though dawn is hours away, she can make out the graceful silhouette of Old Town. She prefers it at night. Sunlight is cruel, revealing lost tiles like rotten teeth; creamy surfaces varnished black by the sooty, cancerous winds that blow in from the north.<br> Against violet clouds, the buildings&#x2019; regal contours assert themselves, and she feels a stab of kinship with these piles of wood and stone: beautiful, proud, soiled, secret.<br> &#x201c;There is a group of Western artists visiting Prague,&#x201d; the Russian says. &#x201c;I believe you are acquainted with one of them.&#x201d;<br> Her chest flutters. Yes, she is acquainted.<br> &#x201c;In three hours, they depart for Vienna. They will convene outside the old synagogue before proceeding to the train station. You will approach your friend and explain that you have been discharged. You will express a desire to leave Czechoslovakia. You will display counterfeit travel documents and ask to go with her and her group, in order to provide cover. She will agree, because you have established a prior relationship with her. There is a recording of a conversation which took place between you, in which she is heard promising to work for your release. Am I correct, little bird? Do you remember she told you that?&#x201d;<br> She will never forget it. She nods.<br> &#x201c;Once in Vienna, you will go to the American embassy. You will describe the horrors of your confinement and offer to defect. To prove your sincerity, you will supply information about a novel design for a nuclear power plant to be constructed outside Tetov. You obtained this information from doktor Ji&#x159;i Pato&#x10d;ka, a physicist with whom you have been romantic. I am sure you will have no difficulty describing your affair with him vividly. Allow me to introduce you.&#x201d;<br> She studies the black-and-white snapshot of a man she has never met.<br> &#x201c;You will receive further instructions when appropriate.&#x201d;<br> She glances at her son.<br> &#x201c;Yes, little bird, he comes, too. You understand we could not speak of this before. You have always been a loyal solider. I admire that quality. But we had to give you a plausible motivation to betray us.&#x201d;<br> She understands perfectly. She prays that her son can understand, too. <br> <i>Do you see, Danek, the purpose of our suffering? Or will you hate me forever?</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So?&#x201d; the Russian says. &#x201c;Happy? Faith is restored?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; Then she worries that she&#x2019;s given the impression that her faith was ever compromised. She says, &#x201c;Hopeful.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Russian laughs. &#x201c;Even better. What is life, without hope?&#x201d;<br> On Pa&#x159;� sk� Street, he eases to the curb. Daniel throws open the door and dashes across the street toward the synagogue, gaping up at its serrated brow. The entire structure appears to be sinking into the earth, as though hell has opened its throat. <br> She gets out, hopping over a ridge of black slush. <br> Wide steps lead from the pavement down to a cramped, cobbled terrace. The Russian kicks aside wet garbage, clearing room to stand. Daniel explores pocks in the synagogue&#x2019;s exterior plaster, rising on his tiptoes in an attempt to grasp the column of iron rungs set into the wall, the lowest of which is still far too high for him. Her heart blossoms at this evidence that he remains a child, unaware of his own limitations.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He points to a peaked door at the top of the rungs, ten meters up. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Really?&#x201d; the Russian says. &#x201c;Nobody has told you?&#x201d;<br> Daniel shakes his head.<br> The Russian smiles at her mildly. &#x201c;You can see for yourself why your nation is doomed. You lack pride.&#x201d; He says to Daniel, &#x201c;This is an important part of Czech culture, little one. You have heard of the golem, surely.&#x201d;<br> The boy fidgets. &#x201c;...yes.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Are you telling the truth, or are you trying to avoid looking stupid?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not his fault,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t teach useless fables in school anymore.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Ah, but must everything have a practical application?&#x201d;<br> She hesitates. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br> The Russian laughs. &#x201c;Well said, <i>soudru ka</i>. Spoken like a true Marxist-Leninist.&#x201d; He smiles at Daniel. &#x201c;I will tell you, little one: through that door is the synagogue garret. You know what a synagogue is? A church for the Jews. Their priest, he is called the rabbi. There was once a very famous rabbi of this synagogue. They say he made a giant from clay. A monster, made of mud, three meters high. Taller than I, and you can see for yourself how tall I am. Fantastic, eh?&#x201d;<br> Daniel smiles shyly.<br> &#x201c;Alas, the creature could not be controlled. It had to be stopped.&#x201d;<br> The Russian kneels, grasps Daniel by the shoulders with his huge hands, the fingertips and thumbs nearly touching. &#x201c;But here&#x2019;s the interesting part. The golem is not dead. It is asleep, right behind that door. And they say that on certain nights, when the moon is full, it wakes up.&#x201d;<br> Daniel tilts his head back, searching the woolly cloud cover.<br> The Russian grins. &#x201c;Yes. And if you are patient, and do what you must, you can draw it out. And if you say the right things, at the right moment, you can grab hold of it, and it becomes yours. It must do anything you command.&#x201d;<br> He gives Daniel&#x2019;s shoulders a squeeze and stands. &#x201c;So? What do you make of that, little one? Do you believe it?&#x201d;<br> Daniel&#x2019;s tongue protrudes in concentration. &#x201c;Jews are dirty.&#x201d;<br> The Russian bellows laughter.<br> She says, &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t speak this way about anyone.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Your mother is right, little one. Dirty or not, you are going to be traveling among them, so you had better mind your mouth. Are you still hungry?&#x201d;<br> The Russian looks at her. He wants his coat back.<br> She hands it over, and he fishes out a chocolate. Daniel begins to tear it open before manners kick in and he glances to her for permission. ...</p><h2>The Dreamweaver: The Story of Mel Fisher and His Quest for the Treasure of the Spanish Galleon Atocha</h2><p>This is the life story of a modern-day legend, of someone who made his dream come true by believing each day that &#34;Today is the day!&#34; Mel fishers&#39;s travel over the treasure tail of Spanish shipwrecks is now worlk famous, but few realize what a bumpy ride it was.

"But then, I don't suppose you have family meals anymore. No one does." </p><p> "Sunday," said Matt. "And anytime there's something on offer the children particularly like." </p><p> "How many you got?" </p><p> "Three. They're my partner's." </p><p> The man nodded. He was used to all kinds of permutations and variations. In fact, he often reckoned the decline of the stable family had been wonderful for his business. </p><p> Matt stood in the center of the big room, unconscious for the moment of Tony, or of anything else except the house. It struck him that he and the house were at a crucial moment in their existence: the house had nothing of him, or of Aileen, but it did <i>have</i> him there, considering, determining its future. And his own. </p><p> He loved it. Standing outside in the lane waiting for Tony he had felt his heart contract at the mere sight of the stone. Stone. Solid, thick, permanent stone. Outside he had heard a radio, loud, from next door through an open window. Inside he heard nothing. And here it was, waiting, with its wood-burning fireplace, its bell push to summon the long-gone servant, its tentative moves in the direction of Art Deco. Eighty years old or more. Waiting for what he, Aileen, and the children were going to make of it. A strange thought struck him. He wondered if a stone house like this might have kept his marriage together. </p><p> Thank God it hadn't. </p><p> "What color were you thinking of?" Tony asked. </p><p> "I thought blue -- not too strong. The windows aren't that large, and it's a long room, so we need something pleasant and airy." </p><p> "Blue. You're thinking of paint, then?" </p><p> "I'll have wallpaper if I find something that I <i>know</i> is right -- something that grabs me round the throat. Otherwise I'll have paint till I find something. Anyway, I like paint: clean colors and clean surfaces." </p><p> Tony nodded, and as they went into the hallway he said, "I wish I could say I'd seen you play." </p><p> Matt shrugged. </p><p> "Why would you? You'd be a Leeds United man. There was no great reason seven or eight years ago to make the effort to see Bradford City play." </p><p> "Seven or eight years ago there was no great reason to go and see Leeds United play. Dullest football in the north was what they served up then." He thought, and then added, "Mind you, the new manager's making a world of difference." </p><p> "He's good with the media too," agreed Matt. "Does one of the best interviews of anyone in the Premier League." </p><p> Tony shot him a quick look, then slapped his thigh. </p><p> "Got you! You're on Radio Leeds. Matthew Harper. I was thrown by the 'Matt.'" </p><p> Matt smiled and nodded, used to the delayed reaction. </p><p> "That's right. I thought I'd take my full name, especially once they started using me for ordinary news-reading and chat shows." </p><p> "I don't hear it that often, I must admit. I go more for music, me. And I never connected the name with the footballer. But I have seen you now and then on 'Look North.'" </p><p> Matt noted that the man, who had shown since he had arrived the sort of casual deference usual to a customer, was now positively respectful. Matt knew from experience that anyone involved with the media, on however low a level, received the degree of deference formerly given to members of the professions. He had got beyond the phase of feeling flattered by unearned respect, so he said briskly, "Let's go upstairs, shall we?...I won't be getting the bedrooms done till we're well settled in. I may even try to do some of it myself, maybe get the children to help." They had gone round the bend in the staircase and were standing on the landing. Tony poked his head into the bedrooms, bathroom, and lavatory. </p><p> "Best leave the bathroom to professionals," he said. "Too fiddly by half. The bedrooms won't present too many problems. Stick to paint there, if you want my advice: then if the children keep wanting theirs changed it won't come too expensive." </p><p> "Yes, I'd already thought of that. Knowing my lot and their clothes and toys and reading matter and habits, they'll want them changed at least once a year." </p><p> "By 'eck, they have it made, the young 'uns these days," said Tony with feeling. </p><p> "Yes, I'd love to know who starts each new vogue. What infant genius suddenly decrees it's yellow this year, and Aussie soaps are out, and shoe soles are three inches high, and the whole childish world bows agreement and starts pestering parents." </p><p> "Probably some future Richard Branson," agreed Tony. "Anyway, you've got four very nice-sized rooms here. That's the advantage of these older houses: you're not squashed in like sardines. When was it built, did you say?" </p><p> "About 1920, the estate agent said, or maybe a bit earlier. Did you see the bells downstairs to summon the servants? I suppose the First World War or its aftermath did away with all that." </p><p> "Happen. Anyway, the kids who go into these new estates won't get bedrooms like these -- cubbyholes more like. And certainly not one each." </p><p> Matt grimaced. </p><p> "Hmm. I was hoping to keep one of the bedrooms for my study. You might not think it to listen to, but a lot of the things I do on Radio Leeds need preparation. It would be good to have somewhere I can shut myself away in." </p><p> "So, two of the kids sharing a bedroom, and one having a bedroom to him- or herself. Sounds like a recipe for nonstop guerrilla warfare to me. And I speak from experience." </p><p> "I was hoping to bribe them by promising them the attic as a games room." </p><p> Tony still looked skeptical. </p><p> "Have you looked at it?" </p><p> "Just poked my head through the trapdoor." </p><p> "Attics are fine for games rooms if you are thinking of things like Monopoly or Trivial Pursuit -- things you can play on the floor. They're pretty useless for snooker tables, or anything you have to stand up for, even supposing you could get a table up there. Want me to have a look?" </p><p> "Would you?" Matt took the pole with the hook on the end, clicked open the trapdoor, then pulled down the metal stairs and tugged at the light cord. He led the way up. </p><p> "There's proper flooring down, but it's pretty old, and I don't know that I'd trust it." </p><p> He stood at the edge of the trapdoor, but Tony, coming up behind him, strode out onto the floor. </p><p> "Sound as a bell. They used good materials in them days. Hasn't been used much, by the look of it. You can see the problem with a games room, can't you? Put a snooker table in the middle and the kid might be all right potting the balls, but he'd hardly be able to straighten up." </p><p> Matt saw his point. </p><p> "It was just an idea. I've never heard our lot express a wish for a snooker table. I might be able to persuade one of them it would be exciting to have one of the bedrooms up here." </p><p> "You might. How old's the eldest?" </p><p> "Isabella's fifteen." </p><p> "You might have more luck with a boy. Still, teenagers like to get away from the others. The young ones may think it would be exciting, but when it comes to it, they get nervous. You might be able to block a small part of this attic off. In fact, it's practically been done for you." </p><p> Tony pointed back toward the trapdoor. Just beyond it was a low piece of brick walling, and when Matt's eyes penetrated the gloom, he could see another one beyond it. He hadn't noticed that section when he'd made a quick exploratory visit before. </p><p> "Roof supports," explained the builder, putting his hand on the rough piece of brick walling. "They've just continued up with the walls from either side of the landing below." He looked down across the roughly constructed brick wall and toward the far wall. "Hmm. They haven't bothered with flooring here. Plenty enough space in this half, I suppose." He climbed carefully over, and walked along one of the beams, Matthew following behind him.

C. Beaton</b> has won international acclaim for her bestselling Hamish Macbeth mysteries and the Agatha Raisin mystery series. She is also the author of more than one hundred romance titles and a series of romantic suspense novels, the Edwardian Mystery series. Born in Scotland, she now divides her time between Paris and the English Cotswolds.</p>From the always sunny Beaton comes this Christmas special of a book featuring policeman Hamish Macbeth (Death of an Addict, etc.) and two minor Yuletide mysteries. In the fishing village of Lochdubh, Christmas looms, but there are no decorations or Christmas trees as the conservative Calvinist population declines to decorate. The lanky and amiable Hamish is told to cover the beat of a neighboring town, Cnothan, as well, where someone has made off with not only the village Christmas lights but also the huge tree. Back in Lochdubh, crusty loner Mrs. Gallagher reports that her beloved cat, Smoky, has been stolen. While investigating, Hamish meets the attractive new schoolteacher, Maisie Pease, who quickly decides she'd like to help Hamish forget his previous love interest, Priscilla Halburton-Smythe. As Hamish works on the two cases, he also makes the acquaintance of the Andersons, a strict and reserved couple whose daughter, Morag, longs for a traditional Christmas. In this mystery without a murder, Beaton reintroduces familiar characters like the spinster Curry sisters and local seer Angus Macdonald, while working in newcomers such as Maisie. It's light fun throughout, though all but Beaton's die-hard readers will find this Christmas carol too cozy by half.

Here is one of the most riveting first-person accounts to ever come out of the Second World War. Robert Leckie was 21 when he enlisted in the US Marine Corps in January 1942. In &#34;Helmet for My Pillow&#34; we follow his journey, from boot camp on Parris Island, South Carolina, all the way to the raging battles in the Pacific, where some of the war&#39;s fiercest fighting took place. Recounting his service with the 1st Marine Division and the brutal action on Guadalcanal, New Britain and Peleliu, Leckie spares no detail of the horrors and sacrifice of war, painting an unsentimental portrait of how real warriors are made, fight, and all too often die in the defence of their country. From the live-for-today rowdiness of Marines on leave to the terrors of jungle warfare against an enemy determined to fight to the last man, Leckie describes what it&#39;s really like when victory can only be measured inch by bloody inch. Unparalleled in its immediacy and accuracy, &#34;Helmet for My Pillow is a gripping account from an ordinary soldier fighting in extraordinary conditions. This is a book that brings you as close to the mud, the blood, and the experience of war as it is safe to come. &#34;&#34;Helmet for My Pillow&#34; is a grand and epic prose poem. Robert Leckie&#39;s theme is the purely human experience of war in the Pacific, written in the graceful imagery of a human being who - somehow - survived&#34;. (Tom Hanks).</p><p>Robert Leckie (1920&#x2013;2001) served in the 1st Marine Division during World War II. After the war, he worked as a reporter for the Associated Press, the New York Journal American, the New York Daily News, and other newspapers. During his lifetime, he authored more than forty books on American war history, including March to Glory, The Battle for Iwo Jima, and The Wars of America: From 1600 to 1900. John Allen Nelson's critically acclaimed roles on television's 24 and Vanished are among the highlights of his twenty-five-plus years as an actor, screenwriter, and film producer. As a narrator, he won an AudioFile Earphones Award for his reading of Zoo Story by Thomas French.<i>Chapter One<br>Boot</i><br><br>A cutting wind slanted up Church Street in the cheerless dawn of January 5, 1942. That day I departed for the United States Marines.<br><br>The war with Japan was not yet four weeks old, Wake Island had fallen. Pearl Harbor was a real tragedy, a burning bitter humiliation. Hastily composed war songs were on the lips of everyone, their heavy patriotism failing to compensate for what they lacked in tune and spirit. Hysteria seemed to crouch behind all eyes.<br><br>But none of this meant much to me. I was aware of my father beside me, bending into the wind with me. I could feel the wound in my lower regions, still fresh, still sore. The sutures had been removed a few days earlier.<br><br>I had sought to enlist the day after Pearl Harbor, but the Marines had insisted that I be circumcised. It cost me a hundred dollars, although I am not sure to this day whether I paid the doctor or not. But I am certain that few young men went off to war in that fateful time so marked.<br><br>We had come across the Jersey meadows, riding the Erie commuter line, and then on the ferry over the Hudson River to downtown New York. Breakfast at home had been subdued. My mother was up and about; she did not cry. It was not a heart-rending leave-taking, nor was it brave, resolute&#x2014;any of those words that fail to describe the thing.<br><br>It was like so much else in this war that was to produce unbounded heroism, yet not a single stirring song: it was resigned. She followed me to the door with sad eyes and said, &#x201c;God keep you.&#x201d;<br><br>It had been a silent trip across the meadows and it was a wordless good-by in front of the bronze revolving doors at Ninety, Church Street. My father embraced me quickly, and just as quickly averted his face and left. The Irish doorman measured me and smiled.<br><br>I went inside and joined the United States Marines.<br><br>The captain who swore us in reduced the ceremony to a jumble. We all held up our hands. We put them down when he lowered his. That way we guessed we were marines.<br><br>The master gunnery sergeant who became our momentary shepherd made the fact plainer to us. Those rich mellow blasphemous oaths that were to become so familiar to me flowed from his lips with the consummate ease of one who had spent a lifetime in vituperation. I would meet his masters later. Presently, as he herded us across the river to Hoboken and a waiting train, he seemed to be beyond comparison. But he was gentle and kind enough when he said good-by to the thirty or forty of us who boarded the train.<br><br>He stood at the head of our railroad car&#x2014;a man of middle age, slender, and of a grace that was on the verge of being ruined by a pot belly. He wore the Marine dress blues. Over this was the regulation tight-fitting overcoat of forest green. Green and blue has always seemed to me an odd combination of colors, and it seemed especially so then; the gaudy dark and light blue of the Marine dress sheathed in sedate and soothing green.<br><br>&#x201c;Where you are going it will not be easy,&#x201d; the gunnery sergeant said. &#x201c;When you get to Parris Island, you&#x2019;ll find things plenty different from civilian life. You won&#x2019;t like it! You&#x2019;ll think they&#x2019;re overdoing things. You&#x2019;ll think they&#x2019;re stupid! You&#x2019;ll think they&#x2019;re the cruelest, rottenest bunch of men you ever ran into! I&#x2019;m going to tell you one thing. You&#x2019;ll be wrong! If you want to save yourself plenty of heartache you&#x2019;ll listen to me right now: you&#x2019;ll do everything they tell you and you&#x2019;ll keep your big mouths shut!&#x201d;<br><br>He could not help grinning at the end. No group of men ever had a saner counselor, and he knew it; but he could not help grinning. He knew we would ignore his every word.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, Sarge,&#x201d; somebody yelled. &#x201c;Thanks, Sarge.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned and left us.<br><br>We called him &#x201c;Sarge.&#x201d; Within another twenty-four hours we would not dare address a lowly Pfc. without the cringing &#x201c;sir.&#x201d; But today the civilian shine was still upon us. We wore civvies; Hoboken howled around us in the throes of trade; we each had the citizen&#x2019;s polite deprecation of the soldier, and who among us was not certain that he was not long for the ranks?<br><br>Our ride to Washington was silent and uneventful. But once we had arrived in the capital and had changed trains the atmosphere seemed to lift. Other Marine recruits were arriving from all over the east. Our contingent was the last to arrive, the last to be crammed aboard the ancient wooden train that waited, puffing, dirty-in-the-dark, smelling of coal&#x2014;waited to take us down the coast to South Carolina. Perhaps it was because of the dilapidated old train that we brightened and became gay. Such a dingy, tired old relic could not help but provoke mirth. Someone pretended to have found a brass plate beneath one of the seats, and our car rocked with laughter as he read, &#x201c;This car is the property of the Philadelphia Museum of American History.&#x201d; We had light from kerosene lamps and heat from a potbellied stove. Draughts seemed to stream from every angle and there was a constant creaking and wailing of wood and wheels that sounded like an endless keening. Strange old train that it was, I loved it.<br><br>Comfort had been left behind in Washington. Some of us already were beginning to revel in the hardship of the train ride. That intangible mystique of the marine was somehow, even then, at work. We were having it rough, which is exactly what we expected and what we had signed up for. That is the thing: having it rough. The man who has had it roughest is the man to be most admired. Conversely, he who has had it the easiest is the least praiseworthy.<br><br>Those who wished to sleep could cat-nap on the floor while the train lurched down through Virginia and North Carolina. But these were few. The singing and the talk were too exciting.<br><br>The boy sitting next to me&#x2014;a handsome blond-haired youth from south Jersey&#x2014;turned out to have a fine high voice. He sang several songs alone. There being a liberal leavening of New York Irish among us, he was soon singing Irish ballads.<br><br>Across the aisle there was another boy, whom I shall call Armadillo because of his lean and pointed face. He was from New York and had attended college there. Being one of the few college men present, he had already established a sort of literary clique.<br><br>The Armadillo&#x2019;s coterie could not equal another circle farther down the car. This had at its center a stocky, smiling redhead. Red had been a catcher for the St. Louis Cardinals and had once hit a home run at the Polo Grounds off the great Carl Hubbell.<br><br>There was no measuring the impact of such a celebrity on our group, composed otherwise of mediocrities like myself. Red had been in the big time. He had held daily converse with men who were nothing less than the idols of his newfound comrades. It was quite natural they should ring him round; consult him on everything from pitching form to the Japanese General Staff.<br><br>&#x201c;Whaddya think it&#x2019;ll be like at Parris Island, Red?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, Red&#x2014;you think the Japs are as tough as the newspapers say they are?&#x201d;<br><br>It is an American weakness. The success becomes the sage. Scientists counsel on civil liberty; comedians and actresses lead political rallies; athletes tell us what brand of cigarette to smoke. But the redhead was equal to it. It was plain in his case what travel and headlines can do. He was easily the most poised of us all.<br><br>But I suspect even Red&#x2019;s savoir-faire got a rude jolt when we arrived in Parris Island. We had been taken from the railroad station by truck. When we had dismounted and had formed a motley rank in front of the red brick mess hall, we were subjected to the classic greeting.<br><br>&#x201c;Boys,&#x201d; said the sergeant who would be our drill instructor. &#x201c;Boys&#x2014;Ah want to tell yawl something. Give youah hearts to Jesus, boys&#x2014;cause youah ass belongs to me!&#x201d;<br><br>Then he fell us in after our clumsy civilian fashion and marched us into the mess hall.<br><br>There were baloney and lima beans. I had never eaten lima beans before, but I did this time; they were cold.<br><br>The group that had made the trip from New York did not survive the first day in Parris Island. I never saw the blond singer again, nor most of the others. Somehow sixty of us among the hundreds who had been aboard that ancient train, became a training platoon, were assigned a number and placed under the charge of the drill sergeant who had delivered the welcoming address.<br><br>Sergeant Bellow was a southerner with a fine contempt for northerners. It was not that he favored the southerners; he merely treated them less sarcastically. He was big. I would say six feet four inches, two hundred thirty pounds.<br><br>But above all he had a voice.<br><br>It pulsed with power as he counted the cadence, marching us from the administration building to the quartermaster&#x2019;s. It whipped us, this ragged remnant, and stiffened our slouching civilian backs. Nowhere else but in the Marine Corps do you hear that peculiar lilting cadence of command.<br><br>&#x201c;Thrip-faw-ya-leahft, thrip-faw-ya-leahft.&#x201d;<br><br>It sounds like an incantation; but it is merely the traditional &#x201c;three-four-your-left&#x201d; elongated by the southern drawl, made sprightly by being sung. I never heard it done better than by our sergeant. Because of this, and because of his inordinate love of drill, I have but one image of him: striding stiff-backed a few feet apart from us, arms thrust out, hands clenched, head canted back, with the whole body following and the great voice ceaselessly bellowing, &#x201c;Thrip-faw-ya-leahft, thrip-faw-ya-leahft.&#x201d;<br><br>Sergeant Bellow marched us to the quartermaster&#x2019;s.

Yet lurking beneath this happy suburban facade was a perverse form of madness which ultimately led to Fagot's suicide. His family watched in disbelief as Fagot took a disturbed teenager for his girlfriend and maimed himself twice for insurance money. The death of his first son-in-law was ruled accidental, but based on his daughter Carol's testimony, Fagot was convicted of murdering her husband. Too close to their father to understand his peculiar psychopathology, the authors' portrayal of their family tragedy is nonetheless emotionally powerful.

Drug prohibitions were few, and while alcohol was considered a menace, the public regularly consumed substances that are widely demonized today. Heroin was marketed by Bayer Pharmaceuticals, and marijuana was available as a tincture of cannabis sold by Parke Davis and Company.<p></p><p>Exploring how this rather benign relationship with psychoactive drugs was transformed into one of confusion and chaos, <i>The Cult of Pharmacology</i> tells the dramatic story of how, as one legal drug after another fell from grace, new pharmaceutical substances took their place. Whether Valium or OxyContin at the pharmacy, cocaine or meth purchased on the street, or alcohol and tobacco from the corner store, drugs and drug use proliferated in twentieth-century America despite an escalating war on &#x201c;drugs.&#x201d;</p><p>Richard DeGrandpre, a past fellow of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and author of the best-selling book <i>Ritalin Nation</i>, delivers a remarkably original interpretation of drugs by examining the seductive but ill-fated belief that they are chemically predestined to be either good or evil.

Now, the idea is commonplace. You've read a dozen books and seen a hundred movies with the same plot idea, but this is where it began.</p><p> A condemned man, due to be executed for a crime he didn't commit, watches and feels the weeks and days and hours slip away as the moment of his execution approaches.</p><p> In case anyone reading the book doesn't quite get it, doesn't quite understand what it means to be able to count the hours before certain death, Irish begins each chapter with a time check. The first chapter is headed: "The Hundred and Fiftieth Day Before the Execution." Chapters 16, 17, and 18 state "The Eighth Day Before the Execution," "The Seventh," and "The Sixth." There are no other words in those chapters because nothing happens. But Scott Henderson is in jail and, so help me, the reader by now feels nearly the same tension that the poor guy must have been feeling. He didn't kill his wife, and he knows he didn't, and we know he didn't, but no one else knows. Oh, yes, one other person knows. The killer knows.</p><p> If you can't stand the suspense, don't read this book. If not knowing what is going to happen next, or in the end, makes you too tense, don't read this book. You won't be able to stand it. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Barry N.

They are the parents of two adult children and make their home in Illinois.Gr. 4^-6. This new entry in the Trailblazer Books series is based on the life of John Newton, the slave trader turned minister who is famous for penning the hymn "Amazing Grace." When 13-year-old Hamilton Jones obtains his freedom, he is determined to avenge himself on the person who enslaved his mother years before. He eventually finds Newton, but doesn't shoot the odd little preacher. Instead, he listens to Newton's story--his bondage to an African woman, his narrow escapes from death, his years at sea, his entry into slave trading, and his gradual awakening to slavery's evils. The Jacksons miss the chance to make Jones a fully realized character, and the contrived plot fails to create any genuine tension between Jones and Newton. Even so, there's enough narrative drive to keep readers involved and make this a worthy introduction to a memorable historical figure and his times.

Sydney Taylor's time-honored classic does just that. Life is rich for the five mischievous girls in the family. They find adventure in visiting the library, going to market with Mama, even dusting the front room. Young readers who have never shared a bedroom with four siblings, with no television in sight, will vicariously experience the simple, old-fashioned pleasures of talk, make-believe, and pilfered penny candy. The family's Jewish faith strengthens their ties to each other, while providing still more excitement and opportunity for mischief. Readers unfamiliar with Judaism will learn with the girls during each beautifully depicted holiday. This lively family, subject of four more "all-of-a- kind" books, is full of unique characters, all deftly illustrated by Helen John. Taylor based the stories on her own childhood family, and the true-life quality of her writing gives this classic its page-turning appeal. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>Meet the All-of-a-Kind Family -- Ella, Henny, Sarah, Charlotte, and Gertie -- who live with their parents in New York City at the turn of the century.<p> Together they share adventures that find them searching for hidden buttons while dusting Mama's front parlor and visiting with the peddlers in Papa's shop on rainy days.

Reprint.</p><p>GEORGE ANASTASIA, a veteran reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, is the author of four books of nonfiction, including three about the Philadelphia mob. He has won many awards for investigative journalism and magazine writing.Up-close and personal perspectives on a consequential Mafia family that law-enforcement agencies and turncoats have all but put out of business. Drawing mainly on interviews with Nick Caramandi (a confessed killer, loan shark, and extortionist now in the Federal Witness Protection Program), Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Anastasia offers a tellingly detailed rundown on a fiefdom encompassing not only his hometown but also Atlantic City from the late 1970's through the mid-1980's. During this violent period, an arguably psychopathic thug named Nicodemo Scarfo headed the local branch of La Cosa Nostra. His regime was notable for unusually savage rub- outs as well as for the systematic corruption of public and union officials. Eventually, however, the deadly don and more than a dozen of his henchmen were convicted on scores of felony murder and RICO charges in a series of trials that began in 1987. Among those responsible for putting Scarfo behind bars was Garamandi, a successful streetwise hustler who had been formally initiated into the mob. The erstwhile wiseguy broke the secret society's vow of silence and became an informer when he learned his capo had marked him for death in the wake of a failed real-estate swindle involving Philadelphia pols. The decision to eliminate Caramandi ranks among the vengeful Scarfo's worst since ``Crow'' (as he's known in gangland circles) provided government prosecutors with the firsthand dope they needed to bring a flock of kingpin outlaws to book. The gossipy stool pigeon here also provides the author an insider's savvy briefing on the quotidian world of organized crime; by Garamandi's credible account, there was appreciably more bad blood than honor among the thieves in thrall to Scarfo.

Even burger-loving omnivores are realizing that adding more plant-based foods to their diet is good for their health and the environment. <em>Big Vegan</em> satisfies both the casual meat eater and the dedicated herbivore with more than 350 delicious, easy-to-prepare vegan recipes covering breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Highlighting the plentiful flavors that abound in natural foods, this comprehensive cookbook includes the fundamentals for adopting a meat-free, dairy-free lifestyle, plus a resource guide and glossary that readers can refer to time and again. Eat your veggies and go vegan!</p><p>Big Vegan is the "big tent" under which all stripes of plant-based eaters can meet and enjoy great tasting food. Whether you call yourself vegan or just want to eat great tasting, healthy food, Big Vegan welcomes you. This is food that nourishes you and respects the planet, all with tons of flavor, texture, color and aroma. Even if you love meat, you will find recipes here that will satisfy you and make you feel great.<br>As the author, I really wanted to put every trick, every technique, and every bit of knowledge I have gleaned over the years into crafting recipes with maximum flavor. In my work in restaurants and as a Private Chef, I have created many dishes to meet my clients needs and desires. Along the way I have learned about the chemistry of food, and how to coax the most from plants in their natural state. That knowledge is what I share in this big, big book, laying out how to harness techniques like reduction and caramelization, and the chemistry of umami. <br>If you are not familiar with umami, it's often called the fifth taste- a sensation of meatiness and satisfying mouthfeel. It's sparked on the tongue by certain chemicals, which are easily found in both meat and plants. It's my belief that omnivores and vegans alike will get more satisfaction from vegan foods if they use foods high in umami, and cook them in ways that amplify it. <br>I believe that the best way to convince people to eat their veggies is to seduce, to tempt with an alluring plate that delights the senses. I hope you will agree that Big Vegan does that and more.<br>Big Vegan is my third book, a follow-up to The New Vegetarian. New Vegetarian has all vegan desserts and half of the food is vegan, in part because even ovo-lacto vegetarians would do well to eat plant based meals often. <br>I've made these dishes for dedicated omnivores and vegans alike, and been delighted by their enjoyment of the food. When serving them, I may not even mention the word "vegan," at least until after my friends and family have tried the food with an open mind. You may find that letting go of labels and just calling it good, real food will help bring people together over your plant-based cuisine.<br>Bon Appetit!.&nbsp;Robin Asbell&nbsp; is the author of three books about cooking with whole, natural foods.

He's a charming young man who had always dreamed of being a fireman, following in the working-class footsteps of his father, who has had to put up his bar in Queens as bond so that his son can stay out of jail until his sentence begins. Monty, named for Montgomery Clift, does not know how he managed to get himself into this predicament.

Frank Slattery is a bond trader, one of the best and most successful risk takers in a very risky business. The other is Jakob Elinsky, an English teacher who envies his friends' lifestyles but who has no intention of ever giving up his job for the easy money, despite the disillusionment of teaching high school students in a tough school.</p><p> The three young men enjoy the night into the early morning as they eat, drink, and visit the hottest spots in town. It's a sad night for Monty, but he has a plan that neither Frank nor Jacob know about--and it makes for a shocking ending to this brilliant and disturbing story. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>David Benioff was born and raised in New York City.

She lectures across the country at universities and other venues, including Esalen, the California Institute of Integral Studies, Common Boundary, and the Colorado Institute for a Sustainable Future. She lives in Prescott, Arizona.Sewall calls herself "a kind of mystic scientist" (she holds a Ph.D. in psychology and the neurophysiology of vision from Brown), a characterization that could easily apply to her field, ecopsychology. Her focus is on research that indicates that visual experiences can alter the structure of neural networks in the brain's neocortex. Because we selectively filter visual information through these memory-laden channels, Sewall believes that our perceptual habits mold and perpetuate our worldview, unless we consciously choose to attend to what we've overlooked. Swinging between lyrical introspection, epiphanies in nature, sociocultural commentary and analysis of the psychology of perception, she attempts to nudge the reader toward making that perceptual shift. Readers who can get past her New Age effusions may otherwise appreciate her style, which hovers somewhere between Annie Dillard and Ken Wilber, and will find some stimulating nuggets. A professor of ecopsychology at Prescott University in Arizona, Sewall points to a host of factors that blunt the average person's sensory awareness, including TV, fragmented lifestyles, ego-based projection and the mind/body disconnect bequeathed to us by Plato. Much of her inquiry flows from engagement with the ideas of James Hillman, John Berger, environmental philosopher David Abram and others. In Sewall's upbeat scenario, many people will adopt new ways of seeing and meditating that will awaken them to the interdependence of all living things. How exactly this will solve the global ecological crisis, as Sewall hopes, remains an open question. Illustrated.

The vital bonds that we form with those we love in life continue long after death&#x2014;in very different ways. <i>Grief Is a Journey</i> is the first book to overturn the prevailing, often judgmental, ideas about grief, and replace them with a hopeful, inclusive, personalized, and research-backed approach. New science and studies behind Dr. Doka&#x2019;s teaching upend the dominant but incorrect view that grief proceeds by stages.<br> <br> In doing so, he helps us realize that our experiences following a death are far more individual and much less predictable than the conventional &#x201c;five stages&#x201d; model would have us believe. Common patterns of experiencing and expressing grief still prevail, yet many other life changes accompany a primary loss. For example, the deaths of parents, even for adults, modify family patterns, change relationships, and alter old family rituals.<br> <br> Unique to this book, Dr. Doka also explains how to cope with disenfranchised grief&#x2014;the types of loss that are not so readily recognized or supported by society. These include the death of ex-spouses, as well as non-fatal losses such as divorce, the end of a friendship, job loss, or infertility. In addition, Dr. Doka considers losses that might be stigmatized, including death by suicide or from disease or self-destructive behaviors such as smoking or alcoholism.<br> <br> Since no two people experience grief in the exact same way, <i>Grief Is a Journey </i>offers a variety of self-help strategies for coping with grief. It delineates the many ways we can create personal and private therapeutic rituals throughout our grief journey. This book also offers counsel on when&#x2014;and where&#x2014;to seek professional assistance. And finally, Dr. Doka reminds us that, however painful, grief provides opportunities for growth.</p><p>Dr. Kenneth J. Doka is a licensed mental health counselor and preeminent expert in grief. He is Professor of Gerontology at the Graduate School of the College of New Rochelle as well as Senior Consultant to the Hospice Foundation of America and an ordained Lutheran minister.&nbsp;Dr. Doka speaks around the world on dying, death, and bereavement, and his work has been featured in national publications and media outlets such as <i>Time</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, CNN, and <i>Nightline</i>.Grief Is a Journey<br> PART 1<br> The Journey of Grief<br> Whatever you love&#x2014;whether a person, a pet, or even an object&#x2014;you may one day lose, for loss is a universal occurrence. And when you lose what you love, whether by separation&nbsp;or death, you grieve that loss; so grief, too, is a universal experience.<br><br> Yet, while the experience of loss is universal, the reactions to that loss are as distinct and individual as you are. Everyone grieves each individual loss in a unique way.<br><br> That fact is paradoxically both troubling and comforting. Troubling, since you want certainty: <i>What can I expect in grief? When will these feelings and reactions end? What is normal? </i>But comforting, too, because it accounts for the wide range of reactions you may be experiencing, and it reminds you that, just as each relationship is unique, so is each loss. Your own reactions have no less worth or validity than those of others around you.<br><br> Yet you still wish for a guide, and <i>Grief Is a Journey </i>offers that guide. Its opening chapters explore the many myths that trouble you as you grieve, and other chapters explore the varied reactions you may experience, as well as the factors that influence the particular manner of your grief.<br><br> This book affirms that as you go forward, you are going to retain a part of the one you have loved. It affirms that grief <i>is </i>truly a journey&#x2014;as lifelong as your love&#x2014;and it shows that you need not journey alone, or without hope.<br><br><b>CHAPTER 1</b><br> The Myths and Realities of Grief<br> It has been eight months since Vicky&#x2019;s husband died, and Vicky is very confused by her own grief. In the first two months she seemed to be coping so well, but in the past six months she feels worse&#x2014;not better. She cries often and is short-tempered at work and at home. She is angry&#x2014;angry at her husband for not taking care of himself; at friends who are not attentive; and even at her children, who are pressuring her, as she says, &#x201c;to suddenly get better.&#x201d;<br><br> Brian is grieving the loss of his son. He thinks of Shay often and lovingly plans an annual carnival in his young son&#x2019;s memory. But his wife, Marla, worries that Brian has not dealt with his grief because he has never cried or talked about his feelings.<br><br> Steve is mourning the death of his lover. He misses him terribly. They spoke daily&#x2014;sharing events and offering advice. Though it has been over a month, Steve still picks up the phone and begins to dial Henry and expects to hear Henry&#x2019;s voice when the phone rings. He wonders if he is going crazy.<br><br> So does Carla, who is mourning her brother. She and her brother both were married and had kids, and they often socialized together, even vacationing as families. It seems so unfair that her brother died so young, only in his forties. But Carla resents everyone who asks how John&#x2019;s wife and children are doing. &#x201c;What about my grief?&#x201d; she says.<br><br> Though their losses and reactions are different, all of these people share a common experience&#x2014;an experience that each one of us will encounter during our lifetime. They are grieving. Grief is the price we pay for love.<br><br> Loss is universal, but our reactions to it are not. Our responses are individual. Psychologists and clinicians have known this for years, but when people are suffering&#x2014;the elderly woman left in an empty home without her husband, the adolescent son of a newly divorced couple, or the mother of a child struck with a debilitating illness&#x2014;grief feels like an uncontrollable burden they must bear alone. Psychologists have learned so much useful information about grief, and how it unfolds, that can help people with their pain. But this information hasn&#x2019;t been given out widely to the public, or even made known to other therapists and clergy. At the same time, there are several myths about grieving that persist and that are damaging people&#x2019;s health and well-being.<br><br> Misconceptions about grief lead more than one million people each year to seek out chemical solutions to their pain, either through alcohol, recreational drugs, or prescription medication. Almost all report that they feel abandoned by family and friends who think that they have failed to &#x201c;get over it&#x201d; in time. Millions experience their grief alone, and they ask themselves, <i>Am I going crazy?</i><br><br> This is why I felt compelled to write this book. I want to help people better understand their grief and to cope with it. I also want to help other counselors who may not know about recent important discoveries about how grief works.<br><br> Although grief is a universal, critical life experience, we often journey through it privately, isolated, afraid to share our feelings&#x2014;worried that our responses may be misunderstood or dismissed. And there is limited public understanding or conversation about the ways we cope with loss. For years, as I have lectured publicly about grief, I am inevitably asked variations of the question raised above. <i>Am I going crazy? What&#x2019;s wrong with me that I am crying all the time? </i>Or, <i>What&#x2019;s wrong with me that I am </i>not <i>crying all the time? What&#x2019;s wrong with me that my grief ebbs and flows? Why do I seem to be getting worse, sadder, rather than better?</i><br><br> When we are grieving, we have a variety of perfectly normal, natural reactions that we may feel are &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; for one reason or another&#x2014;they&#x2019;re strong or inconvenient or unexpected or condemned by our culture or family. We become fearful of sharing these reactions with others, who may not know how to offer support. They may even compound our problem by suggesting, when our reactions are truly natural and normal, that we need professional help. We may lose confidence in our ability to cope at a critical time when we need to adapt in order to survive. Our fears can become reality.<br><br> So I want to try to reassure you that you can cope. You may need some guidance in dealing with your pain, but you can create your own map for navigating your grief. First of all, your feelings are your feelings. You feel what you feel. You may feel sad, angry, or anxious; or a number of other emotions; or a jumble of emotions all at once.<br><br> In my teaching and lecturing, my counseling, and the hundreds of letters I receive as editor of <i>Journeys: A Newsletter to Help in Bereavement, </i>I have learned that most people have two models of how grief works. The first model is that <i>each day, it will get a little easier</i>. That model usually fails because many people get surges of pain that arise from time to time, especially around holidays, birthdays, or anniversaries. Another model of grief is that it proceeds in <i>stages, </i>which is based on Elisabeth K�bler-Ross&#x2019;s five stages. These bereaved persons expect, or are expected by others, to go through phases of denial, anger, bargaining, and depression&#x2014;before they reach acceptance. But the fact is that K�bler-Ross originally saw these stages as reflecting how people cope with illness and dying, not as reflections of how people grieve. Actual experiences of grief are far more individual, often chaotic, and much less predictable.<br><br> Grief is not a single process that everyone experiences the same way. This is critical for you to try to remember. Since we do not experience grief in a predictable set of stages, there is no &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d; way to cope with loss.<br><br> There is also no closure to grief. Grief is not about letting go of past relationships or closing yourself off from them. Even in bereavement, you continue your bond&#x2014;albeit in a different way.<br><br> Grief is not an illness you get over. It is a journey.<br><br> Here are some major principles to keep in mind about this new understanding of grief:<br> � You have personal, individual pathways in grieving<br> � Grief is not only an emotion. It includes physical, behavioral, cognitive, social, and spiritual reactions. Your own responses are influenced by your religion or sense of spirituality, culture, class, gender, and life experiences.<br> � Grief is not at all a relinquishing of ties to the deceased. It is understanding the complex ways that you retain a continuing bond to the person you loved.<br> � You experience many related losses as a consequence of a single loss or death. These secondary losses will also influence your life, and you will want to name and grieve them, too.<br> � You do not simply cope with your loss. There are possibilities for growth inherent in your grief, even though you may not see them for some time.<br><br> People feel grief for many kinds of losses. We grieve the deaths of family members, friends, lovers, and coworkers; sometimes even people we once loved, such as ex-spouses. We mourn the end of a valued friendship whether through death, relocation, or conflict. We grieve transitions and changes in our life. We become attached to dreams, to ideals, to our pets, to possessions, and to people we admire, whether politicians or celebrities, and grieve these losses, as well.<br><br> Twenty-six years ago, Donna angrily divorced her husband Nolan after she became aware of his multiple infidelities. She is stunned by her own grief reactions to hearing of his death. After all, she reasoned, it had been so long and the divorce had been so bitter. Married again now for near twenty years, she finds it difficult to sort out her feelings. Her friends do not understand why she would grieve &#x201c;the creep.&#x201d; She feels awkward to share it with Austin, her present husband. She thinks he would just not understand&#x2014;in fact, it took years for her to trust Austin after her past experience. How can he be expected to understand her grief?<br><br> We grieve other types of losses, too, as we journey through the different stages of life. A mother will feel pain after her preadolescent son objects to a public hug for the first time. Elderly people grieve their loss of independence when they have to give up their driver&#x2019;s license.<br><br> Losses like this are often disenfranchised&#x2014;they are unrecognized and unsupported by other members of society. Sometimes we even discount or dismiss our own pain. We feel <i>disenfranchised grief </i>over losses that are not openly acknowledged, socially sanctioned, or publicly shared. We experience these losses, but we come to believe we do not have the right to grieve them. Frequently, other people in society prohibit our right to grieve losses like these. As a result, we often suffer in silence, not knowing the true cause of our reactions, having no context in which to understand this, and receiving little support and recognition. While the concept of disenfranchised grief has been recognized by researchers and professionals for the past twenty years, this concept has rarely moved beyond specialists in the field.<br><br><i>Grief Is a Journey </i>starts with this groundbreaking yet basic idea from the latest findings on grief: <i>We each have to find our own personal pathway as we deal with loss. </i>Grief is as individual as fingerprints or snowflakes. After all, each of us has our own set of experiences and distinct ways of coping. Every loss is different. Its consequences emerge from our unique relationships and arise from our own singular circumstances. Once you truly accept that basic but liberating concept&#x2014;and once you identify your personal pathway&#x2014;you are empowered to cope. You will find the right way to deal with your pain and memories, you will identify sources of meaningful support, and you will find the right resources to help you cope with your grief.<br><br> Once you identify the ways that grief manifests itself in your own life&#x2014;and in the lives of those you care about and love&#x2014;you can better help yourself, and you will see more clearly how to reach out effectively to support your family and friends who are grieving. This new understanding of grief allows you to answer three critical questions: <i>How can I understand my own pathway? How can I use this knowledge to help me deal with my grief? How can I support those I care about in their grief?</i><br><br> &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;<br><br> I&#x2019;d like to dispel some prevalent myths about how we grieve before we move forward. These myths have been perpetuated for years by laypeople as well as psychologists and counselors, but they have caused pain to millions of people who would otherwise experience their grief in a more natural, healthful way. These myths are pervasive but unsupported by scientific research. Identifying them can keep you from creating unrealistic expectations and allow you to explore a more individualistic and personalized truth&#x2014;your own truth about your loss and your grief.<br><br> OFFERING CONDOLENCES<br> � Nothing you say can ease the pain of the loss. You can show support and empathy by your presence.<br> � Culturally appropriate actions such as bringing food, sending flowers, or making memorial donations are ways that show caring and support<br> � Do not invalidate or minimize the loss. Comments like <i>You are young, You can get married again, Think of the children you still have, She had a very long life, </i>and <i>At least he did not suffer </i>may attempt to comfort, but they do not acknowledge the loss and grief the person is experiencing.<br> � Do not offer platitudes such as <i>He is in a better place </i>or <i>God must have wanted her</i>. Grieving individuals may eventually find comfort from their beliefs, but right now they want the person with them&#x2014;alive.<br> � Do simply say you are sorry for the loss<br> � Do share any special memories of the deceased, as well as the lessons you learned from the deceased or the impact they had on your life. While you may share them at the funeral, send them as well in a letter or card. They will be cherished.<br> � If you wish to help, be specific in what you can do. &#x201c;Can I help get people to and from the airport?&#x201d; or &#x201c;Would you like me to pick up Cody after practice?&#x201d; are far better than &#x201c;Let me know if I can help.&#x201d;</p><h2>Roy Stuart</h2><p>In turns voyeuristic, in turns narrative, Roy Stuart&#39;s photographs, with their disarming explicitness, subvert traditional moral codes and force the viewer to reevaluate his or her preconceived notions of sexuality.</p><p>Text: English, French, German</p><h2>Carousel Horses: A Photographic Celebration</h2><p>Colorful examples of folk art at its most refined, carousel horses are now highly collectible treasures, cherished for their brilliant detail and spirit.

This book has long been considered the best reference for collectors and dealers. Introduced in 1936 by the Homer Laughlin China Company, the colorful Fiesta dinnerware was redesigned in 1969, withdrawn in 1973, and reissued in 1986. This encyclopedia showcases this vibrant dinnerware line, featuring over 1,000 colorful pieces, including coverage of the increasingly popular new lilac color as well as other colors in the new line. There are many new photos that will aid in identification, including several never before seen pieces. In addition to the regular line of Fiesta, this all in one resource includes the other popular lines of Harlequin, Riviera, and Kitchen Kraft. Also featured are experimental items from the Homer Laughlin morgue, as well as the historical information so many collectors crave. In addition, there is a pricing breakdown on the original Fiesta price list. Gorgeous color photos, accurate information, and current values - what more does a collector need? 2001 values. AUTHORBIO: After writing their first book, The Story of Fiesta, published in 1974, the Huxfords became pottery editors for Collector Books and in that capacity wrote several other books on various Ohio potteries: Roseville Pottery, McCoy Pottery, Brush-McCoy Pottery, Weller Pottery, and Roseville Pottery, Volume II.

Ground work which may precede the struggle is explored, as well as basic requirements for effectives. Then the focus turns to the initial impact of the nonviolent challenge. Repression is probable. Determined, yet nonviolent, continued resistance is needed to fight it. The opponent&#39;s repression may rebound by &#39;political jiu-jitsu&#39;, weakening his power by loss of support and increased resistance. Three main mechanisms by which nonviolent action may produce vitory are examined: conversion (the rarest), accomodation, and nonviolent coercion. Massive noncooperation may paralyze and disintegrate even an oppressive system. All these elements of the dynamics of nonviolent struggle are illustrated with examples. The resisting group itself is also changed: it gains in self-respect, confidence and power. Empowerment of the struggle group, the accompanying strengthening of the non-State institutions, ability to defeat repressive elites, and the extension among the populace of a nonviolent struggle capacity, contribute to long-term social changes by redistributing power.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Iron Yoga: Combine Yoga and Strength Training for Weight Loss and Total Body Fitness</h2><p><p>Bodysculpting meets yoga in this revolutionary workout from Ironman triathlete Anthony Carillo.

An eighteenth-century man-of-war boasted mile upon mile of rigging, over 1,000 blocks, and acres of canvas. To reduce the rigging in scale and yet retain an accurate representation is a formidable undertaking. After studying numerous eighteenth-century museum models, the author has drawn some four hundred diagrams which clearly show how each separate item of rigging is fitted to the masts, yards, and sails. Each drawing deals with only one particular aspect and is accompanied by a logical and straight forward narrative. For example, the fore deadeyes and channels are shown before the shrouds are added, and these are depicted before the ratlines are added. Whether a model maker needs to rig a whole ship or just requires information on one aspect, it is all here in this beautifully produced volume that no modeler of period ships should be without. Content remains the same irrespective of the jacket covers in subsequent printings.</p><p>Lennarth Petersson is a model maker and draughtsman who has spent many years studying eighteenth-century rigs and rigging.

It follows Cox's 1998 federal civil rights trial against the Boston Police Department and features a diverse cast of characters, including the victims, their families, the officers accused in the beating, city officials, and the actual murder suspect&#x2014;all set against the rich backdrop of Boston. </p><p>Like J. Anthony Lukas's 1985 Pulitzer Prize-winning classic <em>Common Ground</em>, The Fence examines Boston's race relations and the unwritten police code of covering up through the intimate lens of those who experienced the crime directly. By coming to know the officers and criminals brought together that night at the fence&#x2014;and the families whose lives were changed forever as a result&#x2014;we sense how deeply the strains of prejudice run in this city still haunted by tribalism and racial tension.</p><p>Boston journalist Dick Lehr has written a gritty, captivating true-crime story with unusual depth&#x2014;a chilling exploration of what happens when fear of admitting mistakes combines with a police culture of lying to undermine justice. </p><p>As a reporter for nearly two decades for the <em>Boston Globe</em>, Dick Lehr won numerous journalism awards and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. A professor of journalism at Boston University, he is coauthor of the Edgar Award-winning <em>Black Mass</em>, the Edgar Award finalist <em>Judgment Ridge</em>, and <em>The Underboss</em>.

From the verse of Sappho in 600 BC to Radclyffe Hall&#39;s &#34;The Well of Loneliness&#34;, published in 1928, there is little women&#39;s writing that is recognised as &#34;lesbian&#34;. It is short because while romantic friendship between women was an accepted social institution from the Renaissance to the 19th century, and sex between women appears to have been a staple of pornography since the incarnation of that genre, the possibility of seeing oneself as &#34;a lesbian&#34; had to wait until the emergence of English sexologists in the last decades of the 19th century, who defined lesbianism as a social and sexual category. If by &#34;lesbian literature&#34; we mean work in which the subject of lesbianism is the centre, the history is even shorter. Is there a &#34;lesbian sensibility&#34; that can be identified in literature that may not be concerned specifically with lesbian sexuality? Examining works as diverse as Willa Cather&#39;s &#34;My Antonia&#34;, the poetry of Gertrude Stein, the fiction of Carson McCullers, and the lesbian heroine in the novels of Margaret Atwood, the author seeks to redefine the canon.</p><p></p><h2>A Story To Tell: Classic Book Of Virtues For Children</h2><p>A collection of over 130 short stories first published in 1945 that illustrate such character traits as honesty, courage, and kindness, using examples from the lives of real people in order to build faith in Christ and encourage good works.</p><p></p><h2>A Well-Behaved Woman: A Novel of the Vanderbilts (Thorndike Press Large Print Basic)</h2><p>Marrying into the newly rich but socially scorned Vanderbilt clan, Alva navigates society snubs and dark undercurrents in the lives of her in-laws and friends while testing the limits of her ambitious rule-breaking.

Raised in the Midwest, she moved to North Carolina in 1995. She holds a BA in sociology/cultural anthropology and an MFA in creative writing from North Carolina State University.<p>"In this captivating novel about the indomitable Alva Vanderbilt, Therese Fowler plunges us with wonderful energy into New York's Gilded Age. Alva provides a fascinating prism for the challenges and pleasures of era, and is endlessly engrossing as a character, full of action and vision and will--just the sort of woman I love knowing more about. I dare you not to dive right in."--Paula McLain, author of <i>The Paris Wife </i>and<i> Love and Ruin</i> </p><p>"Oh how I loved every instant I spent in the world Fowler has recreated here. The story of Alva Vanderbilt is elegantly and emphatically told.

Therese Anne Fowler takes us behind the velvet drapes of the Vanderbilt mansions in the late 19th century, exposing a world of passions and betrayal in which all is not as it seems. <i>A Well-Behaved Woman</i> is an extraordinary portrait of a strong, fascinating woman who rose above societal convention and even her own expectations to become so much more than anyone might have predicted." --Christina Baker Kline, <i>New York Times</i> Bestselling author of <i>A Piece of the World</i> and <i>Orphan Train</i></p><p>"The story of Alva Vanderbilt is long overdue for a telling, but it was worth the wait. Therese Anne Fowler has brought this compelling, complex woman to such dynamic life that she leaps off the pages. This is a delicious book, as well as a timely one." --Melanie Benjamin, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>The Girls in the Picture</i></p><p>"In another writer's hands, Alva Vanderbilt's immense wealth and carefully calculated life might have proved barriers to readerly sympathy. But Fowler's portrait is so nuanced, so complicated by context, and so informed by her own capacious generosity that we can't help being drawn in. <i>A Well-Behaved Woman</i> is a deeply and sympathetically imagined guess as to who Alva might have been. This is a wonderful book!" <br>-- Karen Joy Fowler, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Jane Austen Book Club</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>"The best biographical novels reveal a life we never expected to know, and here, in Fowler's jaw-droppingly brilliant <i>A Well-Behaved Woman</i>, she uncovers Alva Smith, who was supposed to be proper and conventional, but instead she not only launched the Vanderbilt's Guilded Age dynasty, but dug in her heels to defy her times in ways that were nothing short of revolutionary. Not just breathtakingly alive, but dazzlingly and profoundly timely. A must-read masterpiece." --Caroline Leavitt, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Pictures of You, </i> <i>Is This Tomorrow</i>, and <i>Cruel Beautiful World</i></p><p>"Activist, egalitarian, philanthropist, trailblazer--these are the qualities of a historic leader. In <i>A Well-Behaved Woman, </i> Therese Fowler illuminates the leading legacy of American heiress Alva Vanderbilt. Alva's gumption and glamour will resonate with modern women and remind all that history belongs to those who courageously persevere. A sparkling, powerful story that needs to be heard now more than ever." --Sarah McCoy, <i>New York Times</i> and international bestselling author of <i>Marilla of Green Gables</i> and <i>The Baker's Daughter</i></p><p>"To step into Therese Anne Fowler's stunning novel is to step into Alva Vanderbilt's rarefied world of sprawling homes, delicious society intrigue, and incomparable Gilded Age luxury. But there's so much more to this world than appearances would indicate--as Alva and the reader both learn. Fowler's heroine is drawn with care and complexity, a woman of exquisite taste and depth, and one who dares to dream beyond the stifling role which society has assigned her." --Allison Pataki, <i>New York Times</i> Bestselling author of 'The Accidental Empress'</p></p><h2>Priscilla Hauser Book of Tole and Decorative Painting: Step-By-Step Techniques, Color Worksheets and Patterns</h2><p>Demonstrates techniques for painting on such surfaces as metalware and old and new wood</p><p></p><h2>Baseball Cards of the Fifties: The Complete Topps Cards 1950-1959</h2><p>A catalog of all Bowman and Topps baseball cards issued from 1950 to 1959</p><p></p><h2>Solzhenitsyn: A Biography</h2><p>Draws on new materials made available by the Solzhenitsyn family and on interviews with the writer himself to create a profile of this complex personality and of the culture from which he emerged</p><p>"'Solzhenitsyn' is an entralling book.

My heart starts to thump and I automatically start searching around for a hiding place.<br><br> OK, maybe this is a slight overreaction. But I&#x2019;ve always been nervous around policemen, ever since I smuggled six pairs of dollies&#x2019; shoes out of Hamleys, at age five, and a policeman came up to me and boomed, &#x201c;What have you got there, young lady?&#x201d; and I nearly jumped out of my skin. He was admiring my helium balloon, it turned out.<br><br> (We sent the dollies&#x2019; shoes back in an envelope after Mum and Dad found them, with a letter of apology, which I wrote myself. And then Hamleys wrote back and said, <i>Don&#x2019;t worry, </i>very nicely. I think that&#x2019;s the first time I realized that writing a letter is actually a very good way to get yourself out of a tricky situation.)<br><br> &#x201c;Luke!&#x201d; I mutter urgently. &#x201c;Quick.

It&#x2019;s a German shepherd and it&#x2019;s sniffing around Luke&#x2019;s feet. Suddenly it looks up at the RV and barks.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh God!&#x201d; Janice emits an anguished cry. &#x201c;I knew it! It&#x2019;s the narcotics squad!

My wife is nuts for that show.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, Letherby is far better than Downton,&#x201d; says Mum. &#x201c;You should visit.&#x201d;<br><br> Out of the corner of my eye I notice Janice, standing in the desert in her aqua floral two--piece dress, madly scattering pills behind a giant cactus. She could hardly be less discreet. But luckily the policemen are distracted by Mum, who is now telling them about Dad&#x2019;s note.<br><br> &#x201c;He left it on his pillow!&#x201d; she&#x2019;s saying indignantly. &#x201c;A &#x2018;little trip,&#x2019; he&#x2019;s calling it. What kind of married man just ups and leaves on a &#x2018;little trip&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Officers.&#x201d; Luke has been trying to get a word in. &#x201c;Thank you for informing me about the taillight. Perhaps we could carry on with our journey now?&#x201d;<br><br> There&#x2019;s a short silence as the cops look consideringly at each other.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t panic,&#x201d; says Minnie, looking up from where she&#x2019;s been playing with her favorite dolly, Speaky. She beams up at one of the policemen. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t panic.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sure thing.&#x201d; He beams back at her. &#x201c;Cute kid. What&#x2019;s your name, honey?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The police <i>won&#x2019;t</i> notice,&#x201d; replies Minnie conversationally, and at once there&#x2019;s a prickly silence. My stomach clenches tight and I don&#x2019;t dare glance at Suze. <br><br> Meanwhile, the smile on the cop&#x2019;s face has frozen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, what did you say?&#x201d; he asks Minnie. &#x201c;Notice what, sweetheart?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Nothing!&#x201d; I say shrilly. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been watching TV; you know what children are like.&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;There we are!&#x201d; Janice arrives by my side, breathless. &#x201c;All done. Hello, officers, what can we do to help you?&#x201d;<br><br> The two cops seem disconcerted to see yet another person joining the group.<br><br> &#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am, where&#x2019;ve you been?&#x201d; asks one.<br><br> &#x201c;I was behind the cactus. Call of nature,&#x201d; Janice adds, clearly proud of her prepared answer.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you have facilities in the RV?&#x201d; says the light-haired cop.<br><br> &#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; says Janice, looking thrown. &#x201c;Oh, goodness. I suppose we do.&#x201d; Her confident air melts away and her eyes dart about wildly. &#x201c;Goodness. Um&nbsp;. . . well&nbsp;. . . in actual fact&nbsp;. . . I felt like a walk.&#x201d;<br><br> The dark-haired cop folds his arms. &#x201c;A walk? A walk behind a cactus?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The police won&#x2019;t notice,&#x201d; says Minnie to Janice confidingly, and Janice jumps like a scalded cat.<br><br> &#x201c;Minnie! Goodness, dear! Notice what? Ha-ha-ha!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you shut that child <i>up</i>?&#x201d; says Alicia in a furious undertone.<br><br> &#x201c;It was a nature walk,&#x201d; Janice adds weakly. &#x201c;I was admiring the cacti. Beautiful&nbsp;. . . um&nbsp;. . . prickles.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Beautiful prickles&#x201d;? Is that the best she could come up with? OK, I&#x2019;m never going on a road trip with Janice again. She looks totally uncool and guilty. No wonder the cops seem suspicious. (I&#x2019;ll admit that Minnie hasn&#x2019;t exactly helped.)<br><br> The policemen are looking at each other meaningfully. Any minute now they&#x2019;re going to say they&#x2019;re bringing us in or calling the feds. I have to do something, quick. But what? Think, <i>think&nbsp;.</i> <i>.</i> <i>.</i> <br> And then inspiration strikes.<br><br> &#x201c;Officer!&#x201d; I exclaim. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad we&#x2019;ve met, because I have a favor to ask. I have a young cousin who&#x2019;d love to become a police officer, and he&#x2019;d be so grateful for an internship. Could he contact you? You&#x2019;re Officer Kapinski. . . .&#x201d; I get out my phone and start typing in the name, copying it off his badge. &#x201c;Perhaps he could shadow you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;There are official channels, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; says Officer Kapinski discouragingly. &#x201c;Tell him to look on the website.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, but it&#x2019;s all about personal connections, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; I blink innocently at him. &#x201c;Are you available tomorrow? We could meet after work. Yes! We&#x2019;ll be waiting for you outside the precinct.&#x201d; I take a step forward and Officer Kapinski backs away. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s so talented and chatty. You&#x2019;ll love him. So we&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow, shall we? I&#x2019;ll bring croissants, shall I?&#x201d;<br><br> Officer Kapinski looks utterly freaked out.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re good to go,&#x201d; he mutt...</p><h2>Galileo and the Magic Numbers</h2><p>A biography of the 16th century mathematician, physicist, and astronomer, who questioned the scientific theories set up by Aristotle and the Church.</p><p></p><h2>Southern Living 1993 Annual Recipes (Southern Living Annual Recipes)</h2><p>Drawing on recipes and food stories from an entire year of &#34;Southern Living,&#34; this reference to outstanding cuisine offers hundreds of recipes, entertaining ideas, and garnishing tips</p><p></p><h2>Stalin Ate My Homework</h2><p>The Sayles might not have been the only Jewish atheist communist family in Liverpool, but Alexei knew from an early age that they were one of the more eccentric.

He parks his battered pickup in front of the Midnight Hotel. The six-to-midnight clerk, a junior college<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freshman named Marina Desoto, later tells Deputy Anna Gomez that when she saw the pickup pull to the curb, she assumed the driver would come in to rent<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a room. Marina does not add that she had been a little excited at the prospect, since in the months she has worked at the hotel only six people have<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; asked for a room during her shift.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marina&#x2019;s hope is dashed pretty quickly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peering out the glass door, she watches the man fall out of the pickup &#x201c;like he was drunk,&#x201d; she tells Deputy Gomez and Sheriff Arthur Smith.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since Gomez knows Marina&#x2019;s family, she also knows Marina is fully conversant with the behavior of drunk people.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What did he do then?&#x201d; the deputy asks.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He walked funny, kind of leaning, like a big magnet was pulling him into the middle of the crossroad. And then he . . .&#x201d; Marina&#x2019;s voice trails off,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and tears roll down her face. She lifts her hand to her head, forefinger pointed and thumb cocked, and mimes pulling a trigger.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You saw this from the front desk?&#x201d; Smith asks. He&#x2019;s checked the line of sight, and he&#x2019;s skeptical.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, you can&#x2019;t see the whole intersection from the desk,&#x201d; Marina says immediately, but not as if she&#x2019;s really thinking about the question. &#x201c;I had<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gotten up and walked to the door to lock it, after I saw him get out of the truck. Because he was acting so weird.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Smart,&#x201d; Gomez says. &#x201c;So he was just carrying a gun in his hand?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He pulled a gun out of his waistband. And he shot himself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gomez makes herself keep her eyes on Marina, though she&#x2019;s tempted to turn to look at the dark heap still crumpled by the road. An ambulance is waiting<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to take the corpse to the nearest medical examiner&#x2019;s office.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t say anything? You didn&#x2019;t see him make a phone call?&#x201d; Sheriff Smith says instead, going over ground already covered. He&#x2019;s seen a cheap cell<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phone in the man&#x2019;s shirt pocket.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No sir,&#x201d; Marina tells him. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t do nothing but get out and shoot himself.&#x201d; And she starts crying again. Deputy Gomez sighs and pats Marina on<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shoulder.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anna Gomez has never liked Midnight, and its people are all guilty until proven innocent to her, no matter what her boss says. But even Gomez can&#x2019;t<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hold the Midnighters responsible for this suicide, though she&#x2019;d love to find a way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gomez gives in to the prickling on her skin and turns to look around her, feeling the eyes on her. The locals are awake and watching. Though this is<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; surely a normal human reaction to a lot of lights and sirens late at night, it doesn&#x2019;t make her feel any more comfortable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Midnight and its people give Gomez the creeps. But she has to admit, none of them approach her to ask questions, and none of them try to get close to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; catch a glimpse of the body.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It never occurs to Anna Gomez that this is because they are all well aware of what a body looks like.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chapter One</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next night, almost all the people in Midnight went up the steps to gather in the pawnshop owned by Bobo Winthrop, owner and proprietor, who worked the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day shift there.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Midnight Pawn was a very old store with wooden floors that creaked in a friendly way. It was crowded with many curious items. The big open area at the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; front of the shop was hospitably full with chairs of all descriptions and ages, which made it made a natural meeting place. The counter, with its high<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stool, was to the left, parallel to the wall. Normally, that was where Bobo sat when there were customers.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when there weren&#x2019;t, like tonight, Bobo sat in his favorite velvet chair. It was very old, and the velvet was worn, but Bobo found it comfortable and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stylish. He&#x2019;d positioned it to give him a good view of his domain, from the loaded shelves that held the strange discards of the human race, to the display<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cases in which objects gleamed and glittered. There was a whole shelf of sanders, for example. And one of bubblegum machines. And jewelry, both real and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fabulously fake.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there was one secluded corner full of magical items. Fiji Cavanaugh, the witch who lived across Witch Light Road, had suggested that Bobo let her<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inspect those before they were placed on display.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonight, Fiji came in first. She smiled at Bobo and found a place to sit where she could see everyone. The witch, a brown-haired woman in her late<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twenties, was literally well rounded and had lovely skin, at least in part because she kept it protected from the Texas sun.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rev and his ward, Diederik, took up chairs beside Fiji. The Rev was a sparse man; short in stature, short of words, thin and bony and dry. His thinning<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dark hair was combed straight back. The Rev always wore the same ensemble: a white shirt, black pants, a black coat, and a black cowboy hat and boots. He<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sported a string tie with a turquoise stone fixing it around his neck. Wearing the same ensemble every day simplified his life.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rev&#x2019;s companion, Diederik, provided a sharp contrast. Diederik radiated health and vitality. The boy looked as though he were nineteen, perhaps<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entering college like Marina Desoto, but that wasn&#x2019;t so. Diederik had a broad olive face, wide violet eyes that slanted a bit, and dark thick hair. He was<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; built like a wrestler, and he moved with grace.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he settled into his chair, Diederik gave Fiji a kiss on the cheek. She smiled at the boy, hoping the smile held nothing but motherly interest. When<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she&#x2019;d met him a few months ago, he&#x2019;d been a little boy. Now he was a full-grown male with a lively interest in females.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiji looked over at Olivia Charity, the only other woman present. Did Olivia, too, have a few slightly conflicted feelings about Diederik? But she sensed<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olivia didn&#x2019;t; that in fact, he was barely a blip on Olivia&#x2019;s radar.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Olivia let Fiji know who she was thinking about. &#x201c;Lemuel&#x2019;s still working on those books,&#x201d; she said to Fiji, who hadn&#x2019;t asked. &#x201c;In fact, he eats,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drinks, and sleeps those damn books.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Golly,&#x201d; said Fiji, who couldn&#x2019;t think of anything more helpful to say. Lemuel could focus like a laser beam, but she&#x2019;d never seen him that concentrated on<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anything. The volumes in question had been hidden in the pawnshop for decades, and for decades Lemuel had looked for them. Then Lemuel had sold the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pawnshop to Bobo, staying on as night manager. Bobo had found the cache, not realized its importance, and moved it up to his apartment, planning to examine<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the books someday. Now Lemuel had discovered he couldn&#x2019;t read the script in one, and naturally, that was the one that was most important, though Fiji<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; didn&#x2019;t know why.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chuy Villegas and Joe Strong, the couple who ran the Antique Gallery and Nail Salon, nodded easily to Bobo as they entered. Chuy patted Fiji&#x2019;s shoulder.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diederik rose and hugged them, and scratched their dog&#x2019;s head. The two took odd chairs, side by side, and set their little Peke, Rasta, down. He snuffled<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; around the room, visiting everyone in turn, and then settled by Chuy&#x2019;s feet.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manfred Bernardo, the psychic who rented the house next door from Bobo, hurried in and threw himself into a chair by his landlord. He gave everyone a wave<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a word. Manfred, almost as small and spare as the Rev, was pierced liberally and with great effect, and lately he had begun getting tattoos. He pulled<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; up his T-shirt sleeve to show the new one on his left shoulder, an ouroboros, to Fiji, and she shook her head, smiling.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why volunteer for pain?&#x201d; she said.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s for my art,&#x201d; Manfred said dramatically, and they all laughed. Manfred regarded the tattoo with admiration. &#x201c;Actually, I think it makes me look<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; badass.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one raised the topic of the evening.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were all waiting on Lemuel, who would be there when the sun set.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October, the sun went down a little before seven thirty p.m. One of the clocks in the pawnshop chimed the half hour, and a minute or two later, Lemuel<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bridger came up from his basement apartment. There was a sense of completion when he took his place in the circle to Bobo&#x2019;s left.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The two were as much of a contrast as the Rev and Diederik. Bobo always seem relaxed, and now that he was in his thirties his blond hair was a little<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faded, and his blue eyes were a little sad. But he still could have been featured in an advertising campaign for something casual but expensive, like<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sunglasses. Lemuel could never pass for human. He was too white, white as bleach, and his eyes were a strange gray. He didn&#x2019;t even move like a human being.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did anyone know the man who killed himself last night?&#x201d; Fiji asked the little crowd. &#x201c;Joshua Allen, right, Manfred?&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they said on the news.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know him,&#x201d; Lemuel said. His hoarse voice was at odds with his white, gleaming appearance. &#x201c;But I knew the first one.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a moment of absolute silence.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The first one. The first what?&#x201d; Olivia said.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The first suicide.&#x201d; Lemuel&#x2019;s pale eyes went from one of them to another. If he was looking for someone to nod in agreement, he was disappointed.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiji was stumped. &#x201c;Are you looking back a decade or something?&#x201d; Vampires could lose track of time.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking back a week,&#x201d; Lemuel said, in a bored way. &#x201c;The first one was at three in the morning last Tuesday. A homeless woman stabbed herself to death<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right under the traffic light. I knew her, a little. Her name was Tabby Ann Masterson.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Olivia had not expected this bombshell. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t tell me,&#x201d; she said.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I could not imagine that it had anything to do with Midnight,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;No one was awake but me.&#x201d;</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lemuel was up all night, of course. Though the pawnshop was up a few steps from the ground level, and though he was often behind the counter, the pawnshop<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sat at the northeast corner of the only intersection in Midnight: the crossroads of Witch Light Road and the Davy highway. And from behind the counter,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lemuel could get a somewhat abbreviated view of what was happening there. If he happened to be closer to the window, his view would be unobstructed.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiji smiled to herself at the long silence. Even if Lemuel had said he&#x2019;d been facing the wall when it happened, none of them would have dared to question<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his word. Lemuel, the oldest of the town&#x2019;s inhabitants by a century, was not a joker, a kidder, or a fantasist.</p><br><p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve met Tabby Ann,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;She used to come by my place, looking for my aunt.

The authors know rocks and took their own incredible, full-color, sharp photographs to depict the detail needed for identification&#x2015;no more guessing from line drawings. The entries are organized by area, so you can find rocks unique to each state or common to all three. With professional pictures and all the details you need to know&#x2015;including what to look for and where to look for it&#x2015;identifying and collecting is more fun and informative than ever!</p><p><b>Dan R. Lynch</b> has a degree in graphic design with emphasis on photography from the University of Minnesota Duluth. But before his love of art and writing came a passion for rocks and minerals, developed during his lifetime growing up in his parents&#x2019; rock shop in Two Harbors, Minnesota. Combining the two aspects of his life seemed a natural choice, and he enjoys researching, writing about, and taking photographs of rocks and minerals. Working with his father, <b>Bob Lynch</b>, a respected veteran of Lake Superior&#x2019;s agate-collecting community, Dan spearheads their series of rock and mineral field guides&#x2015;definitive guidebooks that help amateurs &#x201c;decode&#x201d; the complexities of geology and mineralogy. He also takes special care to ensure that his photographs complement the text and always represent each rock or mineral exactly as it appears in person. He currently lives in Madison, Wisconsin, with his wife, Julie, where he works as a writer and photographer.Lake Superior Rocks &amp; Minerals: A Field Guide to the Lake Superior Area by Bob Lynch &amp; Dan Lynch Small size, bright photography, clear descriptions of rocks and minerals and even an entry on "junk" you'll find on a Lake Superior beach ... this handy volume has what rock pickers are looking for when they are looking at Lake Superior rocks and agates. Bob Lynch, owner of Agate City in Two Harbors, Minnesota, and his son, Dan Lynch, make the perfect knowledgeable guides on a tour of lake stones. Besides a general section on rocks and minerals, the pocket-sized book has separate sections on each of the three Lake Superior shore states - Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. It has a quick guide summary to rocks and to rock shops and museums. Fourteen pages are for the agate and its varied Lake Superior version alone. Each entry has information on where to look for particular minerals or agates. The photography, by Dan, makes it easy to identify what you've picked up off the beach. This is a great guide, but the really cool thing is that after just a few sessions of comparing your beach rocks to this book's descriptions, you'll look like an expert yourself when you impress friends and family with your understanding of what you've found. - Konnie LeMay--Connie LeMay"Lake Superior Magazine" (03/23/2009)</p><h2>The Alexiad (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Anna Comnena (1083-1153) wrote &#34;The Alexiad&#34; as an account of the reign of her father, the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I. It is also an important source of information on the Byzantine war with the Normans, and on the First Crusade in which Alexius participated. While the Byzantines were allied to the Crusaders, they were nonetheless critical of their behaviour and Anna&#39;s book offers a startlingly different perspective to that of Western historians. Her character sketches are shrewd and forthright - from the Norman invader Robert Guiscard (&#39;nourished by manifold evil&#39;) and his son Bohemond (&#39;like a streaking thunderbolt&#39;) to Pope Gregory VII (&#39;unworthy of a high priest&#39;). &#34;The Alexiad&#34; is a vivid and dramatic narrative, which reveals as much about the character of its intelligent and dynamic author as it does about the fascinating period through which she lived.</p><p>Anna Comnena (1083 - 1153) was the eldest child of the Emperor Alexius I. She obtained an education in literature and philosophy due to her position. After a broken engagement to the heir to the throne, Anna was involved in an attempt to assasinate her brother, who had become King. She was exiled to a convent, where she wrote the Alexiad. E.R.A.

We may remember him as a buffalo hunter, a U.S. Army scout, an Indian fighter, a Pony Express rider, and, finally, a master showman who conceived and starred in the world-famous "Wild West" show. But who was the real William "Buffalo Bill" Cody? <p>Now, in the first full-scale biography in over thirty years, Robert Carter scrupulously penetrates the true story of Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s extraordinary life. Spanning the settlement of the Great Plains and the violent Indian Wars, the Gold Rush, the Pony Express, and the building of the first transcontinental railroad, Buffalo Bill&#x2019;s life offers illuminating insight into the enduring romance and adventure of the American frontier&#x2013;especially the Great Plains.</p> <p>This sweeping biography gives us a compelling look at the flamboyant, generous man theIndians called "Long Hair" and the rest of America called the "P. T. Barnum of the AmericanWest." For nearly two generations, from the 1880s to his death in 1917, his traveling show brought the Wild West to life for millions here and abroad, making Buffalo Bill&#x2013;a complicated man with a colorful personality&#x2013;a commanding presence in American history, a man who helped shape our modern perspective on our past.</p> <p>Based on exhaustive research drawn from extensive records, letters, and reminiscences of contemporaries, Buffalo Bill Cody conveys the illuminating saga of life in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries while it presents the fascinating story of the dashing cavalier of the Plains. Here, too, are shimmering portraits of the most famous and important characters of the frontier era, including Wild Bill Hickok, George Armstrong Custer, Sitting Bull, Annie Oakley, Philip Henry Sheridan, and Ned Buntline.</p> <p>Written simply and with great eloquence, Buffalo Bill Cody separates fact from myth and resurrects the remarkable man behind the legend, revealing how an authentic Westerner, a real-life hero, became the arch-purveyor of the romanticized, mythical Wild West that lives on to the present day, in all its adventure, violence, and romance. Buffalo Bill Cody not only gives us a sense of who we were, it provides rich insight into how we have become what we are today.</p>"This is the remarkable story of an amazing life.

A Russian �migr� in 1920s Paris, Brodovitch began his career as a scene painter for Diaghilev's Ballet Russes, and had firmly established himself as a leading art director and graphic designer in New York when he began photographing the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo in the mid-1930s. Shot on 35 mm film, Brodovitch's images radically disregard conventions of "good" technique; blurred and fast-paced, they capture the motion and spirit of dance both in rehearsals and on stage. Errata Editions reproduces every captivating page spread from this rarely seen classic of both dance and photography history, making it at last available to a broader audience.<br><br>The Errata Editions' <i>Books on Books</i> series is an ongoing publishing project dedicated to making rare and out-of-print photography books accessible to students and photobook enthusiasts.

Alexander is Distinguished Professor of History at Ohio University.Hornsby (1896-1963) was ill-educated and taciturn. After playing sandlot and minor league ball, the Texan went to St. Louis in 1915 to play for the Cardinals. Within years he developed from a weak-hitting, error-prone shortstop to a hard-hitting, power-producing second baseman (topping out at .424 in 1924), at his time perhaps the best player in the game after Babe Ruth. The author delves into Hornsby's professional and personal life: his relationship with managers Miller Huggins, Branch Rickey and John McGraw; his scandalous affair and subsequent 20-year marriage to a "flapper"; his personal prohibition on drinking and smoking; his reluctance to watch movies because they might impinge on his eyesight; and his obsession with horse racing-although he never learned to read a racing form. Alexander reviews Hornsby's successful tenure as player-manager of the Cardinals; his subsequent stints with the Giants, Braves, Cubs and Browns; and his career as manager and coach. Alexander (Our Game) has written a thorough if uninspired biography about one of baseball's most talented, yet least recognized, players.

In addition to those in <i>Collected Poems</i> (1988), and in the <i>Early Poems and Juvenilia</i> (2005), some unpublished pieces from Larkin's typescripts and workbooks are included, as well as verse (by turns scurrilous, satirical, affectionate, and sentimental) tucked away in his letters. The manuscript and printed sources have been scrutinized afresh; more detailed accounts than hitherto available of the sources of the text and of dates of composition are provided; and previous accounts of composition dates have been corrected. Variant wordings from Larkin's typescripts and the early printings are recorded. For the first time, the poems are given a comprehensive commentary. This draws critically upon, and substantially extends, the accumulated scholarship on Larkin, and covers closely relevant historical contexts, persons and places, allusions and echoes, and linguistic usage. Due prominence is given to the poet's comments on his poems, which often outline the circumstances that gave rise to a poem, or state what he was trying to achieve. Larkin played down his literariness, but his poetry enrichingly alludes to and echoes the writings of many others; Archie Burnett's commentary establishes him as a more complex and more literary poet than many readers have suspected.</p><p>Philip Larkin was born in 1922 and grew up in Coventry. In 1955 he became Librarian of the Brynmor Jones Library at the University of Hull, a post he held until his death in 1985. He was the best-loved poet of his generation and the recipient of innumerable honours, including the Queen&#39;s Gold Medal for Poetry and the W.H. Smith Award.<p>&#x201c;[The Complete Poems] is a must-have for anyone who enjoys Larkin . . . Burnett&#x2019;s notes offer a fascinating, compendious vade mecum into Larkin&#x2019;s poetic world.

A reader can now trace Larkin's development from his allusive [early efforts] . . . to his more mature, better-known works.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Economist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Apart from representing an unprecedented Larkin poetic storehouse, the other glory of <i>The Complete Poems </i>is Burnett's dazzlingly detailed commentary . . . One of the chief pleasures . . . is tracing the emergence of one of English poetry's most distinctive poetic voices . . . A landmark volume, a wonder-book of verse by one of the art form's best practitioners of the last hundred years.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Terry Kelly, The London Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;More often than any other English poet since the war, Larkin gave us lines that it is unlikely we'll be able to forget.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Ian Hamilton, The Times (London) on Philip Larkin</i></p><p>&#x201c;Larkin is resolute, forthright, witty, and gloomy. This is the man who famously said that deprivation was for him what daffodils were for Wordsworth.

He has never formally studed art; instead, the art community has diligently studied him. They are yet to release their findings.Gr. 4-6. In this fourth installment of the pseudogothic Edgar &amp; Ellen series, which aims at fans of Lemony Snicket, the demented twins' ramshackle mansion becomes targeted by a city beautification project. When Ellen appears to embrace the prospect of gracious living, Edgar investigates his sib's brainwashing, leading to gleeful havoc and discoveries about their freakish housemate, Pet. The send-up of the snooty culture of interior design may go over many children's heads, but those who take twisted satisfaction in the series' misanthropic humor will want this--especially now that Nicktoons plans to air a series of Edgar &amp; Ellen animated shorts. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

There is a great market for religious experience in our world; there is little enthusiasm for the patient acquisition of virtue, little inclination to sign up for a long apprenticeship in what earlier generations of Christians called holiness. <p>Our generation toys dangerously with an I�m-getting-tired-so-let�s-just-quit mentality. And this is not limited to the spiritual realm. Dieting is a daily discipline, so we stay fat. Finishing school is an everyday thing, so we bail out. Cultivating a close relationship is painful, so we back off. Working through conflicts in a marriage is a tiring struggle day by day, so we walk away. Sticking with an occupation is tough on given days, so we change jobs. </p><p>The let's-just-quit mentality is upon us. </p><p>Ignace Jan Paderewski, the famous Polish pianist and statesman, was once scheduled to perform at a great concert hall in America. It was a black-tie affair, a high society extravaganza. Present in the audience that evening was a woman who had brought her nine-year-old son, hoping that he would be encouraged to practice the piano if he could just hear the great Paderewski at the keyboard. Weary of waiting for the concert to begin, and being there against his wishes anyway, the lad squirmed restlessly in his seat. Then, as his mother turned to talk with friends, the boy slipped out of his seat and down the aisle, strangely drawn by the ebony concert grand sitting majestic and alone at the center of the huge stage. He sat down on the tufted leather stool, placed his small hands on the black-and-white keys, and began to play "Chop Sticks." Suddenly the crowd hushed, and hundreds of frowning faces turned in his direction. Irritated and embarrassed, some began to shout, "Hey, get that boy away from there!" "Where�s his mother?" "Somebody stop him!" </p><p>Backstage, Paderewski heard the uproar and the sound of the simple tune. When he saw what was happening, he hurried onto the stage. Without a word to the audience, he walked up behind the lad, reached his arms around either side of him, and began to improvise a countermelody. As the two made music together, the master pianist kept whispering in the boy's ear, "Keep going. Don't quit, son. Keep on playing . . . don't stop . . . don't quit." </p><p>So it is with us. We hammer away at life day by day, and sometimes it seems about as significant as "Chop Sticks." Then, about the time we are ready to give up, along comes the Master, who leans over and whispers, "Don�t quit. Keep going," as He provides His divine countermelody of grace, love, and joy at just the right moment. </p><p>Are you one of those weary pilgrims? Is the road getting long? Is hope wearing a little thin? Don't quit. Keep on . . . day by day. Finish the course. </p><p>Are you discouraged? Do you wonder if you'll ever get this parenting business right? Will your hopes and dreams ever be realized? Does it seem too long a wait? </p><p>Don't give up . . . at least not today. </p><p>Just keep listening to the good news of the Master day by day, and joy and holiness will be yours until the day Jesus comes to take you home.</p></p><h2>Eye of the Needle</h2><p><p>One enemy spy knows the secret of the Allies&#x2019; greatest deception, a brilliant aristocrat and ruthless assassin&#x2014;code name: &#x201c;The Needle&#x201d;&#x2014;who holds the key to the ultimate Nazi victory.</p><p></p><p>Only one person stands in his way: a lonely Englishwoman on an isolated island, who is coming to love the killer who has mysteriously entered her life.</p><p></p><p> Ken Follett&#x2019;s unsurpassed and unforgettable masterwork of suspense, intrigue, and dangerous machinations of the human heart.</p><p></p></p><p>Ken Follett is the author of numerous international bestsellers, including Jackdaws, Hornet Flight, Code to Zero, Triple, Eye of the Needle, Pillars of the Earth, and A Dangerous Fortune.

Reconnaissance planes brought back photographs of barracks and airfields and fleets of ships in the Wash; General George S. Patton was seen in his unmistakable pink jodhpurs walking his white bulldog; there were bursts of wireless activity, signals between regiments in the area; confirming signs were reported by German spies in Britain.</p><p>There was no army, of course. The ships were rubber-and-timber fakes, the barracks no more real than a movie set; Patton did not have a single man under his command; the radio signals were meaningless; the spies were double agents.</p><p>The object was to fool the enemy into preparing for an invasion via the Pas de Calais, so that on D-Day the Normandy assault would have the advantage of surprise.</p><p>It was a huge, near-impossible deception. Literally thousands of people were involved in perpetrating the trick. It would have been a miracle if none of Hitler&#x2019;s spies ever got to know about it.</p><p>Were there any spies? At the time people thought they were surrounded by what were then called Fifth Columnists. After the war a myth grew up that MI5 had rounded up the lot by Christmas 1939. The truth seems to be that there were very few; MI5 did capture nearly all of them.</p><p>But it only needs one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>It is known that the Germans saw the signs they were meant to see in East Anglia. It is also known that they suspected a trick, and that they tried very hard to discover the truth.</p><p>That much is history. What follows is fiction.</p><p>Still and all, one suspects something like this must have happened.</p><p><i>Camberley, Surrey, June 1977</i></p><p></p><p></p><p>PART ONE</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>IT was the coldest winter for forty-five years. Villages in the English countryside were cut off by the snow and the Thames froze over. One day in January the Glasgow-London train arrived at Euston twenty-four hours late. The snow and the blackout combined to make motoring perilous; road accidents doubled, and people told jokes about how it was more risky to drive an Austin Seven along Piccadilly at night than to take a tank across the Siegfried Line.</p><p>Then, when the spring came, it was glorious. Barrage balloons floated majestically in bright blue skies, and soldiers on leave flirted with girls in sleeveless dresses on the streets of London.</p><p>The city did not look much like the capital of a nation at war. There were signs, of course; and Henry Faber, cycling from Waterloo Station toward Highgate, noted them: piles of sandbags outside important public buildings, Anderson shelters in suburban gardens, propaganda posters about evacuation and Air Raid Precautions. Faber watched such things&#x2014;he was considerably more observant than the average railway clerk. He saw crowds of children in the parks, and concluded that evacuation had been a failure. He marked the number of motorcars on the road, despite petrol rationing; and he read about the new models announced by the motor manufacturers. He knew the significance of night-shift workers pouring into factories where, only months previously, there had been hardly enough work for the day shift. Most of all, he monitored the movement of troops around Britain&#x2019;s railway network; all the paperwork passed through his office. One could learn a lot from that paperwork. Today, for example, he had rubber-stamped a batch of forms that led him to believe that a new Expeditionary Force was being gathered. He was fairly sure that it would have a complement of about 100,000 men, and that it was for Finland.</p><p>There were signs, yes; but there was something jokey about it all. Radio shows satirized the red tape of wartime regulations, there was community singing in the air raid shelters, and fashionable women carried their gas masks in couturier-designed containers. They talked about the Boer War. It was at once larger-than-life and trivial, like a moving picture show. All the air raid warnings, without exception, had been false alarms.</p><p>Faber had a different point of view&#x2014;but then, he was a different kind of person.</p><p>He steered his cycle into Archway Road and leaned forward a little to take the uphill slope, his long legs pumping as tirelessly as the pistons of a railway engine. He was very fit for his age, which was thirty-nine, although he lied about it; he lied about most things, as a safety precaution.</p><p>He began to perspire as he climbed the hill into Highgate. The building in which he lived was one of the highest in London, which was why he chose to live there. It was a Victorian brick house at one end of a terrace of six. The houses were high, narrow and dark, like the minds of the men for whom they had been built. Each had three stories plus a basement with a servants&#x2019; entrance&#x2014;the English middle class of the nineteenth century insisted on a servants&#x2019; entrance, even if they had no servants. Faber was a cynic about the English.</p><p>Number Six had been owned by Mr. Harold Garden, of Garden&#x2019;s Tea and Coffee, a small company that went broke in the Depression. Having lived by the principle that insolvency is a mortal sin, the bankrupt Mr. Garden had no option but to die. The house was all he bequeathed to his widow, who was then obliged to take in boarders. She enjoyed being a landlady, although the etiquette of her social circle demanded that she pretend to be a little ashamed of it. Faber had a room on the top floor with a dormer window. He lived there from Monday to Friday, and told Mrs. Garden that he spent weekends with his mother in Erith. In fact, he had another landlady in Blackheath, who called him Mr. Baker and believed he was a traveling salesman for a stationery manufacturer and spent all week on the road.</p><p>He wheeled his cycle up the garden path under the disapproving frown of the tall front-room windows. He put it in the shed and padlocked it to the lawn mower&#x2014;it was against the law to leave a vehicle unlocked. The seed potatoes in boxes all around the shed were sprouting. Mrs. Garden had turned her flower beds over to vegetables for the war effort.</p><p>Faber entered the house, hung his hat on the hall-stand, washed his hands and went in to tea.</p><p>Three of the other lodgers were already eating: a pimply boy from Yorkshire who was trying to get into the Army; a confectionery salesman with receding sandy hair; and a retired naval officer who, Faber was convinced, was a degenerate. Faber nodded to them and sat down.</p><p>The salesman was telling a joke. &#x201c;So the Squadron Leader says, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re back early!&#x2019; and the pilot turns round and says, &#x2018;Yes, I dropped my leaflets in bundles&#x2014;wasn&#x2019;t that right?&#x2019; So the Squadron Leader says, &#x2018;Good God! You might&#x2019;ve hurt somebody!&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>The naval officer cackled and Faber smiled. Mrs. Garden came in with a teapot. &#x201c;Good evening, Mr. Faber. We started without you&#x2014;I hope you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;</p><p>Faber spread margarine thinly on a slice of wholemeal bread, and momentarily yearned for a fat sausage. &#x201c;Your seed potatoes are ready to plant,&#x201d; he told her.</p><p>Faber hurried through his tea. The others were arguing over whether Chamberlain should be sacked and replaced by Churchill. Mrs. Garden kept voicing opinions, then looking at Faber for a reaction. She was a blowsy woman, a little overweight. About Faber&#x2019;s age, she wore the clothes of a woman of thirty, and he guessed she wanted another husband. He kept out of the discussion.</p><p>Mrs. Garden turned on the radio. It hummed for a while; then an announcer said: &#x201c;This is the BBC Home Service. <i>It&#x2019;s That Man Again!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>Faber had heard the show. It regularly featured a German spy called Funf. He excused himself and went up to his room.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Mrs. Garden was left alone after <i>It&#x2019;s That Man Again</i>; the naval officer went to the pub with the salesman; and the boy from Yorkshire, who was religious, went to a prayer meeting. She sat in the parlor with a small glass of gin, looking at the blackout curtains and thinking about Mr. Faber. She wished he wouldn&#x2019;t spend so much time in his room. She needed company, and he was the kind of company she needed.</p><p>Such thoughts made her feel guilty. To assuage the guilt, she thought of Mr. Garden. Her memories were familiar but blurred, like an old print of a movie with worn sprocket holes and an indistinct sound track; so that, although she could easily remember what it was like to have him here in the room with her, it was difficult to imagine his face or the clothes he might be wearing or the comment he would make on the day&#x2019;s war news. He had been a small, dapper man, successful in business when he was lucky and unsuccessful when he was not, undemonstrative in public and insatiably affectionate in bed. She had loved him a lot. There would be many women in her position if this war ever got going properly. She poured another drink.</p><p>Mr. Faber was a quiet one&#x2014;that was the trouble. He didn&#x2019;t seem to have any vices. He didn&#x2019;t smoke, she had never smelled drink on his breath, and he spent every evening in his room, listening to classical music on his radio. He read a lot of newspapers and went for long walks. She suspected he was quite clever, despite his humble job: his contributions to the conversation in the dining room were always a shade more thoughtful than anyone else&#x2019;s. He surely could get a better job if he tried. He seemed not to give himself the chance he deserved.</p><p>It was the same with his appearance. He was a fine figure of a man: tall, quite heavy around the neck and shoulders, not a bit fat, with long legs. And he had a strong face, with a high forehead and a long jaw and bright blue eyes&#x2014;not pretty like a film star, but the kind of face that appealed to a woman. Except for the mouth&#x2014;that was small and thin, and she could imagine him being cruel. Mr. Garden had been incapable of cruelty.</p><p>And yet at first sight he was not the kind of a man a woman would look at twice. The trousers of his old worn suit were never pressed&#x2014;she would have done that for him, and gladly, but he never asked&#x2014;and he always wore a shabby raincoat and a flat docker&#x2019;s cap. He had no mustache, and his hair was trimmed short every fortnight. It was as if he wanted to look like a nonentity.</p><p>He needed a woman; there was no doubt of that. She wondered for a moment whether he might be what people called effeminate, but she dismissed the idea quickly. He needed a wife to smarten him up and give him ambition. She needed a man to keep her company and for&#x2014;well&#x2014;love.</p><p>Yet he never made a move. Sometimes she could scream with frustration. She was sure she was attractive. She looked in a mirror as she poured another gin. She had a nice face and fair curly hair, and there was something for a man to get hold of.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. She giggled at that thought. She must be getting tiddly.</p><p>She sipped her drink and considered whether <i>she </i>ought to make the first move. Mr. Faber was obviously shy&#x2014;chronically shy. He wasn&#x2019;t sexless&#x2014;she could tell by the look in his eyes on the two occasions he had seen her in her nightdress. Perhaps she could overcome his shyness by being brazen. What did she have to lose? She tried imagining the worst, just to see what it felt like. Suppose he rejected her. Well, it would be embarrassing&#x2014;even humiliating. It would be a blow to her pride. But nobody else need know it had happened. He would just have to leave.</p><p>The thought of rejection had put her off the whole idea. She got to her feet slowly, thinking: I&#x2019;m just not the brazen type. It was bedtime. If she had one more gin in bed she would be able to sleep. She took the bottle upstairs.</p><p>Her bedroom was below Mr. Faber&#x2019;s, and she could hear violin music from his radio as she undressed. She put on a new nightdress&#x2014;pink, with an embroidered neckline, and no one to see it!&#x2014;and made her last drink. She wondered what Mr. Faber looked like undressed. He would have a flat stomach and hairs on his nipples, and you would be able to see his ribs because he was slim. He probably had a small bottom. She giggled again, thinking, I&#x2019;m a disgrace.</p><p>She took her drink to bed and picked up her book, but it was too much effort to focus on the print. Besides, she was bored with vicarious romance. Stories about dangerous love affairs were fine when you yourself had a perfectly safe love affair with your husband, but a woman needed more than Barbara Cartland. She sipped her gin and wished Mr. Faber would turn the radio off. It was like trying to sleep at a tea dance!</p><p>She could, of course, ask him to turn it off. She looked at her bedside clock; it was past ten. She could put on her dressing gown, which matched the nightdress, and just comb her hair a little, then step into her slippers&#x2014;quite dainty, with a pattern of roses&#x2014;and just pop up the stairs to the next landing, and just, well, tap on his door. He would open it, perhaps wearing his trousers and under- shirt, and then he would <i>look </i>at her the way he had <i>looked </i>when he saw her in her nightdress on the way to the bathroom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Silly old fool,&#x201d; she said to herself aloud. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just making excuses to go up there.&#x201d;</p><p>And then she wondered why she needed excuses. She was a grown-up, and it was her house, and in ten years she had not met another man who was just right for her, and what the <i>hell</i>? She needed to feel someone strong and hard and hairy on top of her, squeezing her breasts and panting in her ear and parting her thighs with his broad, flat hands, for tomorrow the gas bombs might come over from Germany and they would all die choking and gasping and poisoned and she would have lost her last chance.</p><p>So she drained her glass and got out of bed and put on her dressing gown, and just combed her hair a little and stepped into her slippers, and picked up her bunch of keys in case he had locked the door and couldn&#x2019;t hear her knock above the sound of the radio.</p><p>There was nobody on the landing. She found the stairs in the darkness. She intended to step over the stair that creaked, but she stumbled on the loose carpet and trod on it heavily; but it seemed that nobody heard, so she went on up and tapped on the door at the top. She tried it gently. It was locked.</p><p>The radio was turned down and Mr. Faber called out, &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>He was well-spoken, not cockney or foreign&#x2014;not anything, really, just a pleasantly neutral voice.</p><p>She said, &#x201c;Can I have a word with you?&#x201d;</p><p>He seemed to hesitate; then he said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m undressed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So am I,&#x201d; she giggled, and she opened the door with her duplicate key.</p><p>He was standing in front of the radio with some kind of screwdriver in his hand. He wore his trousers and <i>no </i>undershirt. His face was white and he looked scared to death.</p><p>She stepped inside and closed the door behind her, not knowing what to say. Suddenly she remembered a line from an American film, and she said, &#x201c;Would you buy a lonely girl a drink?&#x201d; It was silly, really, because she knew he had no drink in his room and she certainly wasn&#x2019;...</p></p><h2>Firebird (Fairy Tales, Book 1)</h2><p>In Firebird, Lackey draws inspiration from the classic Russian fairy tale to present a marvelous coming-of-age fantasy with a most unusual setting: medieval Russia before unification under the Tsars.<br>Ilya is the son of the boyar, a Russian prince.

Ilya's father and brothers swear to capture the magical creature - but each fails. When Ilya disobeys his father and makes his own attempt to catch the Firebird, he is banished.<br>The young man journeys through a fantastical Russia full of magical mazes, enchanted creatures, and untold dangers. Gifted with the ability to understand the speech of animals, Ilya saves the life of a fox, who becomes his most steadfast companion.<br>As happens in the best fairy tales, Ilya falls in love with an enchanted princess. To free her, he must battle a cantankerous wizard and a powerful dragon. Magic swirls throughout this battle as Ilya uses his wits, his warrior's and magical skills, and some very unusual allies to save the day and win true love.</p><p>Mercedes Lackey never puts a foot wrong in this confident, funny fairy-tale adaptation. Tsar Ivan has eight sons; all are brutes like himself except for happy-go-lucky, least-favored Ilya.

Plankton are organisms&#x2014;comparable to sea larvae and tiny jellyfish&#x2014;that drift in oceans, seas, and bodies of fresh water. The word zooplankton comes from the Greek zoion, meaning animal, and planktos, meaning wanderer or drifter.<br> <br>Their migration isn&#x2019;t like the journey of whales or butterflies or flamingoes over thousands of miles or like caribou who circle the same arctic edge every year. The daily migration of these unseeable creatures is a persistent drift from depth to surface and back to depth. Along the way, they eat and process phytoplankton and, through their daily rite of survival, they serve as a filtering agent and so play their role in the aquatic food web. Innately, they both survive and contribute to the survival of the waters they live in.<br> <br>This daily odyssey can span a few feet in small ponds or as far as five hundred yards in the open sea. Environmentalist Alan Burdick tells us that this is equivalent to a human being rowing a small boat five hundred miles every day to breakfast and back!<br> <br>This is microscopic evidence that we need to work very hard to arrive where we are. The journey is inevitable&#x2014;essential to our own survival and the health of the Universe we are a small part of. In fact, it&#x2019;s fair to assume that every part of life has its own version of this daily migration by which it exercises its being into place.<br> <br>This persistent drifting from depth to surface and back is particularly instructive for the life of the soul, and how we need to stay in the world and process our experience in order to feed and cleanse both our working spirit and the small part of the Universe we inhabit. For years, I thought I was inwardly fickle, struggling to surface when drowning in the deep, only to be battered at the surface and long for the stillness of the depth. And now these microscopic creatures present a fractal of the larger physics at work. Now I wonder about the practice of persistent drift&#x2014;from depth to surface and back&#x2014;and how the many aspects of being and becoming are all part of the constant cleansing action that keeps us and life healthy.<br> <br>In spiritually practical ways, this book is an inquiry into the practice of persistent drift: into the cleansing action of introspection, creativity, love, friendship, and how we deal with pain; into our need to stay in the world and process our experience; into the very hard and inevitable work to arrive where we are; and into the soul&#x2019;s daily migration from depth to surface and back. Relentlessly, the sea of life keeps us vital and buoyant while we in our small way serve as tiny cleansing agents of the sea of life. Mysteriously, spirit is known by its movement through the depth of the world, the way wind is known by its movement through waves and trees and prayer flags strung along the mountain&#x2019;s ridge.<br> <br>So still yourself briefly and picture an infinite wave of zooplankton pulsing their way up through the planet&#x2019;s water and down again, cleansing it as they go. Imagine the tiniest cells of being rising within you this very moment, cleansing your thoughts and feelings. Imagine how you and I pulse our way through the days eating and processing the food of relationship, meaning, and care. All of us processing each other, drifting toward the healthiest exchange, the way plants and humans exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide.<br> <br>Despite our endless plans, we are animals of being drifting with an instinct to survive and process. Despite our endless struggles, our need to survive and process is cleansing. It&#x2019;s beautiful and humbling to realize that the spirit inherent in each thing on Earth, including worms and flowers, is migrating to where it is and that this pulsation of being is the self-cleansing agent of all life-force. After all this way, it&#x2019;s never been about getting to the surface or getting to the bottom, but the inborn call to inhabit the journey in between.<br> <br> The daily migration is a persistent drift from depth to surface and back to depth. This is how we deal with pain and stay in the world while cleansing life itself&#x2014;through introspection, creativity, love, and friendship.<br> A Reflective Pause<p></p> <br>�&nbsp;In your journal, describe one way that you move between depth and surface during your day.

But she may die for this one as well. Because each question raises many others -- and every hard-won answer reveals secret passions and explosive truths that could doom an overly inquisitive journalist with a tendency to leap before she looks.</p></p><p>In her seventh outing for Miami crime reporter Britt Montero, Edna Buchanan (herself an erstwhile journalist for <i>The Miami Herald</i>) serves up a nice twist on a standard plot. The body of a beautiful naked woman floats in on the tide practically at Britt's feet, and it turns out to be that of a woman supposedly murdered a decade before by her wealthy husband. Most of the action focuses on freeing R.J. Jordan, the convicted killer, from his cell on death row. R.J., a handsome but decidedly unpleasant guy who maintained his innocence all along, isn't the slightest bit interested in apprehending his wife's killer. He's just happy her body turned up before he died for her murder. But Britt wants to know where Lily Jordan's been for the last 10 years, and why she came back to Miami just days before her husband was due to die. <p> To Britt's surprise, her own mother has an important clue, although it's all Britt can do to pry it out of her. Not only did the elegant, socially well- connected Montero matriarch know the victim, she even mentored Lily as she rose through the executive ranks of the Jordan family business. The new explications of the complicated relationship between Britt and her mother is a plus for fans of this bestselling series, who appreciate Buchanan's deft characterizations as well as her love for the city she has called home all her (and Britt's) life. As an extra fillip, there's Britt's growing relationship with the investigator who helped put R.J. away 10 years ago, a nice counterpoint to this ingenious updating of <i>Double Indemnity</i>. Buchanan's pacing is dead-on, as she stays one step ahead of even the most discerning reader right up to the explosive conclusion. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Twilight of the Gods (Doctor Who Missing Adventures)</h2><p>The second Doctor returns to Vortis with his companions Jamie and Victoria.

Just after D-Day, Colette Florin hid downed American bomber pilot Roy Allen in her rooms above the tiny girls' school where she taught. While concealing him not only from the Germans but from her neighbors in the small village, she was drawn deeper into the clandestine world of the regional underground. There she met the local leader of the resistance: Pierre Mulsant, a young Frenchman trained by the British secret service who had parachuted into France in the spring of 1944. <br>Drawn from extensive interviews, letters, and archival documents in Britain, France, Germany, and the United States, <i>In the Shadows of War </i>tells their interrelated stories, following these three fascinating people from their Resistance activities in rural France, to Paris and captivity by the Gestapo, to Germany and Buchenwald concentration camp. It is a human story of love and loss, of courage and sacrifice by ordinary people who did not make policy or formulate strategy but whose lives were profoundly altered by war.<br></p><p>Thomas Childers is a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of four previous books on World War II, including <i>The Wings of </i><br><i>Morning</i>. He lives in Media, Pennsylvania.<br>The paths of three unlikely comrades-a schoolteacher in a rural French town, a downed bomber pilot from Philadelphia, a British-trained French bourgeois saboteur-meet and merge between November 1943 and May 1945. Local teacher Colette Florin, active as support for various resistance operations, provides intermittent shelter on the school's unused upper floor for Pierre Mulsant, who might otherwise have lived comfortably off his family's construction business, after he parachutes in from England in 1943. American flyer Roy Allen, after several successful missions, is shot down in June 1944 and ends up at Florin's schoolhouse as well. Florin is at risk of betrayal not only from collaborators but from neighbors with "petty jealousies and old grievances." As the friendship of the three develops, Allen, restless in confinement, attempts an ill-advised passage to liberated Paris only to be delivered to the Gestapo and sent to Buchenwald. He soon meets up with Mulsant, who has also been betrayed. Mulsant is executed. Allen makes it though the war and visits Florin before returning to the States. University of Pennsylvania historian Childers (The Nazi Voter) delivers this grim, stirring account with rich characterization, believable dialogue, graphic scene setting, telling details and pacing that are rare for military history. He places his heroic central figures among their families, their co-workers (the plane's crew, the transmitter operator, the demolition expert), their co-conspirators (the milkman, the postman, the public prosecutor), those who assist them, those who betray them and those who are their captors and torturers. Using military archives, private papers and interviews as well as memoirs and firsthand accounts, Childers gives us an extensive, pointed cross-section of the war in France from the perspectives of those who knew the stakes, and acted. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Scruples: a Novel</h2><p>The spellbinding story of the rise of a fascinating woman from fat, unhappy &#34;poor relative&#34; of an aristocratic Boston family to a unique position among the super-beautiful and super-rich, a woman who got everything she wanted - fame, wealth, power and love.</p><p></p><h2>Early American Stencils on Walls and Furniture (Dover Stencils)</h2><p>In the first quarter of the 19th century, stenciling was an important decorative art in America, most notably in New England.

This compelling story, and the breathtaking photographs that accompany it, offer a chance to do just that. During a dramatic three-day ride across miles of high desert, Monty Roberts used all his skill to connect with the little mustang he finally befriended. In the year that followed, Shy Boy grew to love life on the farm, playfully demanding attention, and becoming fascinated by children. After a year of challenges and one frightening illness, the wild horse's exceptional spirit earned the respect and admiration of his trainers. And, as a result of a PBS-aired program based on his initial encounter with Roberts, <em>Shy Boy</em> gained international fame.</p><p>Yet throughout this extraordinary year, Monty Roberts struggled with the question, "Would <em>Shy Boy</em> rather be free?" With trepidation, he took Shy Boy back to the wild to let him choose. The event, and its stunning conclusion, are memorably captured in these magnificent photographs and in a story that is both unforgettable and inspiring.</p></p><p>Celebrated as "the real horse whisperer," Monty Roberts made his literary debut with <i>The Man Who Listens to Horses</i>--half autobiography, half introductory lesson to "Equus," or the language of horses. In <i>Shy Boy</i>, Roberts returns with the story of a wild mustang he captured and domesticated using his renowned, nonviolent training technique. Beginning with the stunning Cuyama Valley in California, where he tracked the young stallion Shy Boy for three days, and moving on to the horse's gradual acclimation to human contact, Roberts walks the reader through the slow, detailed process. In the course of this equine odyssey, he stitches in inspiring anecdotes, as in the case of Samantha, an ailing 12-year-old who used Monty's method: "She saved a horse from an untimely end in a slaughterhouse and spared herself further harm--and she had done it without ever raising a hand or even her voice." However, the real credit for this book should probably go to the photographer, Christopher Dydyk, whose 100 or so colorful glossies dominate the book's 236 pages, with dazzling shots of the ranch, the range, and Monty at work. With brilliant graphics and easy-to-read language, <i>Shy Boy</i> is ideal for a young horse lover. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i>In <i>Shy Boy</i>, with 100 beautiful full-colour photographs by Canadian Christopher Dydyk, world-famous horse gentler Monty Roberts reveals the unique rapport he shares with one special horse: a wild mustang. During a dramatic three-day ride across a hundred miles of high desert, Monty Roberts had to use all his skill to connect with the wild horse, and in a gripping, intimate narrative he relives their unique relationship. <br> <br>Throughout the year that followed, Shy Boy lived on the farm, full of impish high spirits, fascinated by children, earning the respect and admiration of his trainers. As his fame grew following the PBS documentary of his initial three-day encounter with Monty Roberts, he received visitors from all over the world, and Monty Roberts was asked, "Would Shy Boy rather be free?" With trepidation, he took him back to the wild to let him choose: Go with your herd, or stay with humans.

Be my philosophy, be my science&#x201d;); his impressions of the patients, himself included, and their strange life at curative baths and spas (&#x201c;Russians, both men and women, go into the baths naked . . . Alarm among the Southerners&#x201d;); and about the &#x201c;clever way in which death cuts us down, but makes it look like just a thinning-out.&#x201d;<br><br>Given Barnes&#x2019;s crystalline translation, these notes comprise a record&#x2014;at once shattering and lighthearted, haunting and beguiling&#x2014;of both the banal and the transformative experience of physical suffering, and a testament to the complex resiliency of the human spirit.</p><p>Alphonse Daudet was born in N�mes, France, in 1840. Novelist, playwright, and journalist, his success came through his novels and stories. He contracted syphilis at the age of seventeen and died at the age of<br>fifty-seven.<br><br>Julian Barnes is the author of nine novels, a book of stories, and a collection of essays. He is the recipient of the Prix Femina, and in 1988 was made an Officier de l&#x2019;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He lives in London.A popular writer in his time and admired by Charles Dickens and Henry James, French novelist, playwright and journalist Alphonse Daudet (1840-1897) has been largely forgotten today. According to novelist and essayist Barnes (Something to Declare, etc.), Daudet's work, although considered charming and topical in its heyday, did not have the depth and relevance to transcend its age-with one exception, this small volume, translated into English now for the first time. Basically a loose journal of ideas, metaphors and observations, the book offers a devastating emotional and spiritual portrait of a main in profound physical pain in the tertiary stage of syphilis. Daudet continued to write and publish during his illness, though he experienced bouts of rheumatism and severe fatigue, which progressed on to debilitating "locomotor ataxia (the inability to control one's movements), and finally, paralysis." Daudet's descriptions of his physical ailment are palpably horrifying, and the feelings of isolation and inadequacy that result give readers a new understanding of the psychology of illness. Of the "sheer torture" of his pain, Daudet ultimately concludes that there are no words, "only howls." Words, he says, "only come when everything is over.... They refer only to memory, and are either powerless or untruthful." However inadequate the author may believe his words to have been, the indomitable spirit of life that is conveyed on every one of these pages is Daudet's ultimate triumph. 4 illus. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Modern Reader&#39;s Japanese-English Character Dictionary</h2><p>Both old and new forms of characters are presented and arranged under the traditional radical system</p><p><b>Andrew M.

There are kings and queens, popes and politicians, soldiers and merchants, scholars, authors and visionaries. They range from the important, such as El Cid or Frederick Barbarossa, to the little known, such as the dissolute Venetian nun Clara Sanuto. Some were astonishingly successful: the empire created by Chinggis Khan was one of the most extensive ever seen. Some, such as Charles the Bold, the over-ambitious 15th&#x2013;century duke of Burgundy, were failures.</p><br> Contrary to modern myth, medieval people did not believe the earth was flat; torture was far less common than in later centuries; and technological advances included guns, printing, blast furnaces, spectacles, stirrups and the compass. Full of insights such as these, this book shows how medieval people lived in an era that was more one of invention and innovation than of superstition and backwardness. It will appeal to all those who want a truer picture of a world often erroneously portrayed by bestselling novelists of today. 179 illustrations, 171 in color</p><p>Michael Prestwich is Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Durham.

But as engineer Gustave Eiffel built the now-famous landmark to be the spectacular centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, he stirred up a storm of vitriol from Parisian tastemakers, lawsuits, and predictions of certain structural calamity.<br><br> In <i>Eiffel's Tower</i>, Jill Jonnes, critically acclaimed author of <i>Conquering Gotham</i>, presents a compelling account of the tower's creation and a superb portrait of Belle Epoque France. As Eiffel held court that summer atop his one-thousand-foot tower, a remarkable host of artists and personalities-Buffalo Bill, Annie Oakley, Gauguin, Whistler, and Edison-traveled to Paris and the Exposition Universelle to mingle and make their mark.<br><br> Like <i>The Devil in the White City, Brunelleschi's Dome</i>, and David McCullough's accounts of the building of the Panama Canal and the Brooklyn Bridge, <i>Eiffel's Tower</i> combines technological and social history and biography to create a richly textured portrayal of an age of aspiration, dreams, and progress.</p><p>Jill Jonnes is the author of <i>Conquering Gotham, Empires of Light</i>, and <i>South Bronx Rising</i>.

There are, however, numerous collections of anecdotes and aphorisms that may serve to convey the sensibility which underscores the practice of Zen.

The sun had just hit the horizon, turning the craggy mountains orange against a clear sky.<br> <br>The scene couldn&#x2019;t have been more different from the smoggy, traffic-choked Pakistani cities he&#x2019;d spent the last two months in. Swapping the stench of diesel and sweat for the idyllic setting of South Africa&#x2019;s wine country should have been a pleasant change. If anything, though, it had tightened the knot in his gut.<br> <br>When he&#x2019;d killed the fundamentalist director of Pakistan&#x2019;s intelligence apparatus a few weeks ago, blowback had been inevitable. But now it had grown beyond even his and Irene Kennedy&#x2019;s worst-case scenario.<br> <br>There was still no question that Ahmed Taj&#x2019;s elimination had been necessary in order to keep Pakistan&#x2019;s nuclear arsenal out of the hands of Islamic hardliners. Unfortunately, his death had left a power vacuum that was pushing the already unstable country to the brink. Umar Shirani, the head of the army, was using the growing chaos to continue Taj&#x2019;s effort to oust the country&#x2019;s relatively moderate president.<br> <br>One of the keys to his plan was to gain control of Pakistan&#x2019;s nuclear arsenal, confident that the world would be forced to back anyone with the means and will to incinerate a large swath of the region. Or, if not back, at least not oppose.<br> <br>To that end, General Shirani had taken the country&#x2019;s nukes from their secure locations and was moving them around Pakistan in order to keep the civilian government from extending its authority over them. Of course, he said that his actions were to keep the weapons safe in the increasingly unstable environment, but no one actually believed him. He was forcing a showdown&#x2014;making Pakistan&#x2019;s politicians and power elite choose sides.<br> <br>Rapp and his teams had been charged with trying to track the weapons&#x2019; movements and to make sure that none of Pakistan&#x2019;s terrorist groups got hold of one. It was a virtually impossible task. They were being asked to follow the constantly moving individual components of the world&#x2019;s seventh-largest nuclear arsenal while being actively opposed by its sixth-largest army. It was a little like the old cup and ball magic trick, but with a hundred balls&#x2014;each one of which had the potential to explode and take out a major city.<br> <br>Rapp rolled down the window and accelerated the vehicle, navigating by his memory of a map he&#x2019;d glanced at months ago. He&#x2019;d never actually been to the area, instead relying on a CIA team that specialized in selecting these types of locations.<br> <br>And that&#x2019;s exactly what Irene Kennedy had tried to get him to continue to do: rely on specialists. Despite everything that was happening in Pakistan, though, he couldn&#x2019;t bring himself to pass this one off. So he&#x2019;d put Scott Coleman in charge and boarded the CIA&#x2019;s Gulfstream G550 for South Africa.<br> <br>A mistake? Most likely. Dereliction of duty? Maybe. But better to deal with this situation personally over the next twenty-four hours than to spend the next week trying to micromanage it from Islamabad.<br> <br>The phone on the passenger seat chimed and he grimaced when he saw it was another text from Monica Estridge. The subject was the same as the last twenty unanswered messages from her. Granite.<br> <br>He&#x2019;d given the surprisingly relentless interior designer complete dominion over finishing the construction of the house he&#x2019;d started before his wife was killed. Unfortunately, she didn&#x2019;t seem to understand the simple concept of &#x201c;complete dominion.&#x201d; He had no idea how many swatches, paint colors, and wood finishes there were on the planet, but he was pretty sure she wasn&#x2019;t going to rest until he&#x2019;d looked at every one.<br> <br>The dirt road began to climb toward a mountain striped with cliff bands and Rapp made sure he kept the vehicle&#x2019;s speed at a level that wouldn&#x2019;t attract attention. When he reached the top of the first rise, he spotted the gray roof of the home he was looking for.<br> <br>A ten-foot-tall wall topped with colorful shards of broken glass ringed the property and the trees had been cut back almost to a neighboring farmer&#x2019;s vines, leaving an open perimeter with an unobstructed view.<br> <br>The scene probably wasn&#x2019;t appreciably different than it would have been if he&#x2019;d been riding in on horseback at the turn of the twentieth century. Just beneath the surface, though, was a state-of-the-art security system that was not only connected to local police and a private security response team but to the CIA&#x2019;s top people in the country.<br> <br>At his direction, Claudia Gould&#x2014;now Dufort&#x2014;and her daughter had moved in recently. Despite a long, painful history and the death of her husband at the hands of Stan Hurley, Rapp couldn&#x2019;t get her out of his mind. They seemed to be tangled together in a way that no amount of effort could reverse.<br> <br>It was hard to reflect on his relationships with women without using the words &#x201c;disaster&#x201d; and &#x201c;catastrophe.&#x201d; On particularly bad days, &#x201c;cataclysm&#x201d; also sprang to mind. His first love had died in the terrorist attack on Pan Am 103 when he was still young. Years later, his wife and unborn child had been murdered by Louis Gould, the late husband of the woman living in the spotless Cape Dutch house he was passing.<br> <br>Since then, Rapp had tried futilely to find someone he could fit into his life. His wife, Anna, had been an idealist and in some ways that was why he&#x2019;d loved her so intensely. While he was constantly mired in the dark, she saw the world with unflagging optimism and hope. Being with her helped him regain the humanity that sometimes seemed to be slipping irretrievably away.<br> <br>In retrospect, though, their relationship hadn&#x2019;t been all sunshine and flowers. Anna had struggled constantly with what he did for a living. Intellectually, she understood that men like him were necessary, but he&#x2019;d come to believe that on a deeper level she thought he might be part of the problem. Just another violent man who kept the world from becoming the utopia she thought it could be.<br> <br>So, another Anna Reilly was out.<br> <br>He'd once tried going in the opposite direction with a talented Italian private contractor, but the relationship had been doomed from the start. On the bright side, she'd been beautiful, exciting, and completely unconcerned with his lifestyle. On the other hand, he&#x2019;d never been able to shake the feeling that for the right price, she&#x2019;d start chasing him around the bedroom with an ice pick.<br> <br>After Anna, his relationships could be categorized as brief encounters that barely rose above the level of one-night stands. A former Secret Service agent. A hedge fund manager his brother had introduced him to. A redheaded air force pilot who occasionally flew support on a few of his ops.<br> <br>But Claudia felt different for some reason. They&#x2019;d first met years ago when he&#x2019;d come to settle a score with her husband. He&#x2019;d put a gun against her head, and to say the look in her eyes haunted him would be an overstatement. But he sure as hell hadn&#x2019;t forgotten it.<br> <br>Claudia&#x2019;s background wasn&#x2019;t spotless like Anna&#x2019;s, but neither was it drenched in blood like Donatella&#x2019;s. She had a beautiful daughter and a soul that was just damaged enough for her to consider allowing someone like him into her life.<br> <br>That sense of possibility was why he&#x2019;d gotten personally involved with relocating Claudia and providing her with an immaculate new identity. Or at least an identity that he&#x2019;d been assured was immaculate. Now, a reliable informant had told him, someone was looking to snatch her. Precisely who or why, no one seemed to know.<br> <br>The likely bet was that one of her late husband&#x2019;s enemies had come crawling out from under a rock for some petty revenge. It was the kind of amateur bullshit that really pissed Rapp off and he was there to set an example that would discourage the next asshole.<br> <br>It was another reason not to get Irene Kennedy&#x2019;s people involved. As the director of the CIA, there were lines she shouldn&#x2019;t cross. And his plan to identify the people stalking Claudia and then mail them back to their employer in FedEx envelopes was probably one of them.</p><h2>The Age of Autism: Mercury, Medicine, and a Man-Made Epidemic</h2><p><p><i>A groundbreaking book, THE AGE OF AUTISM explores how mankind has unwittingly poisoned itself for half a millennium</i></p><p></p><p>For centuries, medicine has made reckless use of one of earth's most toxic substances: mercury&#x2014;and the consequences, often invisible or ignored, continue to be tragic. Today, background pollution levels, including global emissions of mercury as well as other toxicants, make us all more vulnerable to its effects. &nbsp;From the worst cases of syphilis to Sigmund Freud's first cases of hysteria, from baffling new disorders in 19th century Britain to the modern scourge of autism, THE AGE OF AUTISM traces the long overlooked history of mercury poisoning.</p><p>Now, for the first time, authors Dan Olmsted and Mark Blaxill uncover that history.&nbsp; Within this context, they present startling findings:&nbsp; investigating the first cases of autism diagnosed in the 1940s revealed an unsuspected link to a new form of mercury in seed disinfectants, lumber fungicides and vaccines. In the tradition of Silent Spring and An Inconvenient Truth, Olmsted and Blaxill demonstrate with clarity how chemical and environmental clues may have been missed as medical "experts," many of them blinded by decades of systemic bias, instead placed blamed on parental behavior or children's biology. By exposing the roots and rise of The Age of Autism, this book attempts to point the way out &#x2013; to a safer future for our children and the planet.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Mark Blaxill was a senior partner at The Boston Consulting Group and is now a managing partner at 3LP Advisors. The father of a child diagnosed with autism, he has been involved in autism advocacy for over a decade and has written widely on the scientific controversies surrounding autism</p><p>Dan Olmsted is Editor of Age of Autism. He has been a journalist for 35 years and was an original staff member of USA Today and Senior Editor of USA WEEKEND and United Press International. He lives in Falls Church City, Virginia and is a member of the National Press Club.</p><p></p><p>We believe that autism was newly discovered in the 1930s for the simple reason that it <i>was </i>new. The organic chemicals industry that grew out of chemical warfare research during World War I led to new commercial uses for mercury, including the introduction of an extraordinarily toxic compound made from ethylmercury. This, our research suggests, led directly to the first cases of autism. Among the parents of those first eleven cases described in 1943, you will meet a plant pathologist experimenting with ethylmercury fungicides in Mary land; a pediatrician in Boston who was an early champion of mass vaccinations containing ethylmercury; and a stenographer in a pathology lab in Washington, D.C., who spent her workday exposed to mercury fumes while her future husband, a psychiatrist, treated syphilis with mercury just as Freud had done decades earlier. Several other families cluster around the medical profession, agriculture, and forestry&#x2014; the three biggest risk factors for exposure to mercury in its newest and most toxic form. Psychiatrist Leo Kanner provided some clues to the backgrounds of these early parents&#x2014; such as their professions&#x2014; but our investigation uncovered dramatic new details about what the parents were doing when each child was born and in the critical years before that.</p><p>By the time our research was done, we had worked our way through newspaper clippings, professional archives, city directories, cemetery records, ancestry searches, last- known addresses, and libraries from Washington, D.C., to Moscow, Idaho. We found and interviewed family members of several of the first eleven children; most memorably, we met two of those &#x201c;cases&#x201d; ourselves. At the end of our search, we talked with &#x201c;Case 1: Donald T.&#x201d; around the kitchen table in his lifelong home in the small lumber town of Forest, Mississippi. By any measure, he has fared astonishingly well. President of his college fraternity and later the Forest Kiwanis Club, a pillar of his Presbyterian church, he had a long career at the local bank, plays a competitive game of golf, and regularly travels the world. We learned how &#x201c;Donald T.&#x201d; went from being the first unmistakable case of autism to the first unmistakable case of <i>recovery. </i>He also reminds us how recent autism is&#x2014; the space of one man&#x2019;s lifetime: &#x201c;Donald T.&#x201d; turned seventy- seven in September 2010.</p><p>Leo Kanner&#x2019;s original cases, linked only by this overlooked association with mercury, suggest that from the very beginning autism was an environmentally induced illness&#x2014; a toxic injury rather than something inherited or inculcated. Certainly, some children were more susceptible to mercury exposure&#x2014; and that may implicate genetic vulnerabilities.&nbsp; This is very different, however, from saying that autism is an inherited genetic disorder.</p><p>Tragically, the best and the brightest in science and medicine have missed these clues from the start, blinded first by the belief the parents were responsible and then by their ongoing pursuit of the &#x201c;autism gene.&#x201d; The Great Autism Gene Hunt has come up empty&#x2014; but continues to drain off millions of dollars and thousands of hours that should go to more promising environmental research.</p><p>Having thoroughly failed to solve the autism puzzle, the medical industry is putting forth a new wave of epidemic deniers to claim autism isn&#x2019;t really increasing after all. Simply put, this idea is nonsense; and sadly, it prolongs the epidemic and prevents the urgent response this public health crisis demands.</p><p>In tracing the history of autism, we cannot avoid discussion of what we have already acknowledged as a controversial topic: vaccines. Some critics have labeled us antivaccine for even broaching the subject. But our interest has more to do with vaccination as a risk factor, perhaps one of several. We want to state explicitly that we <i>support </i>vaccines as long as they are individually and collectively tested for safety, and not deployed excessively, as part of an overall policy to promote childhood health. We are not antifungicide or antivaccine or anti- anything but autism. We support progress and innovation. (Mercury was removed from fungicides in the 1970s for safety reasons after several episodes of mass poisoning.) We don&#x2019;t want crops to wither, or houses to rot, or children to die of vaccine- preventable illnesses. We simply want to stop an autism epidemic whose origin we believe can be discerned from a careful examination of its environmental history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<i>Copyright � 2010 by Dan Olmsted and Mark Blaxill.&nbsp; Reprinted by permission.

Now in paperback: the book that Andrew Weil calls <i>&#x201c;offbeat, informative, and fun . . . a great read,&#x201d;</i> and that has been praised as <i>&#x201c;a delightful dance through science&#x201d;</i> (<i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Mark Hyman, M.D.) and as a <i>&#x201c;remarkable and insightful book [that] offers you the chance to achieve the best health of your life&#x201d;</i> (Mark Liponis, M.D., Medical Director, Canyon Ranch).<br><br>Written by bestselling author Gene Stone, <i>The Secrets of People Who Never Get Sick </i>arose from his desire to discover what might actually prevent him from getting sick himself. This book, the result of that exploration, tells the stories of twenty-five people who each possess a different secret of excellent health&#x2014;a secret that makes sense and that Stone discovered has a true scientific underpinning. There are food secrets&#x2014;why to take garlic and vitamin C, eat more probiotics, become<br>a vegan, drink a tonic of brewer&#x2019;s yeast. Exercise secrets&#x2014;the benefits of lifting weights, the power of stretching. Environmental secrets&#x2014;living in a Blue Zone, understanding the value of germs. Emotional secrets&#x2014;seek out and stay in touch with friends, cultivate your spirituality. Physical secrets&#x2014;nap more, take cold showers in the morning.

He lives in New York City and is a vegan (secret #17). His website is www.secretsofpeople.com.</p>Former Esquire editor Stone has collaborated on a number of health and diet titles, and here he relates the results of his own quest to avoid colds and flu. The 25 practices Stone discovered, he contends, may also keep readers free from major illnesses and contribute to longer, healthier lives. Each chapter contains a personal story culled from those Stone collected from people of diverse ages and backgrounds (an 85-year-old marathon champion, actor George Burns, Stone's sixth-grade teacher, a Chinese man reputed to have lived more than 200 years, etc.) and the secrets that kept them well; sections with scientific data; and Stone's recommendations. Along with widely accepted medical wisdom (plant-based diet; adequate sleep; exercise; yoga; satisfying relationships; positive attitude), Stone includes eyebrow raisers; e.g., taking cold showers, eating dirt, and dousing in hydrogen peroxide. Between these extremes, Stone offers insights into debates on brewer's yeast, probiotics, alkalizing diets, and detoxification. In an afterword, he reveals which practices have worked for him and suggests one that might be most powerful of all: the placebo effect. Stone's bottom line: whichever healthy practices readers pursue, consistency and absolute belief in their efficacy are key ingredients in the wellness recipe. (Nov.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

His adventure took him from Cuzco to Urubamba, on to Puno and Juli on Lake Titicaca, down to Arequipa and finally back to Lima. The expedition was led by a writer and poet and the party included a Swiss international skier and jeweller, a social anthropologist from Provence and a Nottinghamshire farming squire - all seasoned mountaineers. The other two participants - the author himself and a botany-loving duke - were complete novices. As the group travelled from Lima into increasingly remote parts of the country, Leigh Fermor captured their experiences in a series of letters to his wife. Whether recounting the thrill of crossing a glacier, the rigours of campsite life under a blanket of snow, their lively encounters with locals or the strangely moving sight of a lone condor circling in the sky, the author vividly conveys the excitement of discovery and the intense uniqueness of the land.</p><p>After his famous walk across Europe - recounted in A Time of Gifts and Between the Woods and the Water - Patrick Leigh Fermor lived and travelled in the Balkans and the Greek Archipelago. In the Second World War he joined the Irish Guards, became a liaison officer in Albania and fought in Greece and Crete - living disguised as a shepherd in the mountains for two years organising resistance activities. He was awarded the DSO and CBE, and a knighthood in the 2004 new Year Honours List.He makes exotic and entertaining friends wherever he goes, has read everything, been everywhere, known everyone and writes like a dream * The Times * His grand style perfectly captures the country&#39;s generous people and magnificent landscape ...

Publication was 1907, seven years before the first MACHINERY&#39;S HANDBOOK in 1914. This was a time of great change technologically. Where many of the things described are timeless, many others are quite dated. Machines covered in detail by Hasluck, including construction drawings, had not yet matured to their most enduring form as they would in just a few short years. Tools common to us such as the Jacobs chuck and standard lathe tool post had not yet been invented. Metallurgy still thought that crystallization leading to failure occurred in use rather than during heat treatment.</p><p></p><h2>From Seed to Pumpkin (Let&#39;s-Read-and-Find-Out Science 1)</h2><p><p>Pumpkins can be baked in a pie.</p> <p>Pumpkins can be carved into jack-o'-lanterns.</p> <p>Pumpkin seeds can be roasted for a healthy snack.</p> <p>But how does a tiny seed turn into a big pumpkin?</p> <p>Read and find out what a pumpkin seed needs to help it grow!</p></p><p><p> Wendy Pfeffer devotes her time to writing and conducting workshops on creative writing.

Davie. Ms. Pfeffer lives in Pennington, New Jersey. </p>PreS-Gr. 2. This satisfying volume from the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out series tells and shows how a pumpkin plant grows. With a level of detail that seems just right for young children, the text clearly presents how the plant develops from seed to mature pumpkin as well as how it obtains and distributes water and nutrients. Pfeffer uses plain English rather than specialized terminology, explaining processes with precision while keeping the text accessible to her audience. Though the only character mentioned in the text is the farmer, the artwork features three children who join him to drop seeds into the ground, water them, and observe the plants as they grow. Their cheerful presence adds to the appeal of the illustrations, which are precise, pleasing drawings tinted with sunlit colors. The last two pages give instructions for two activities, "Roasted Pumpkin Seeds" and "How Plants Drink Water." An excellent introduction to plant development in general and pumpkins in particular. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Fraught with opportunities to make mistakes, occasions to feel guilty, and the drive to "do it yourself." The pressure to be self-sufficient is high, but it isn't the life God offers.</p><p>The way of the world will direct you to try harder and work smarter so that you can take care of yourself and even make yourself successful. But the way of the cross will point toward the place where you stop striving ... stop pushing ... stop every self-initiated effort -- so that you can fall into the boundless, liberating, refreshing grace of God!</p><p>Just imagine being love-driven instead of self-propelled. Imagine abandoning your life to Jesus instead of trying to save yourself. Can you imagine exchanging your fears for that peace that passes understanding? Being relaxed and free instead of stressed-out and anxious? If you can imagine enjoying God instead of trying to repay him, then you can imagine grace.</p><p>So go ahead! Jump off the cliff of self-sufficiency. Leap out of legalism. Walk off the pier of guilt and condemnation. That's the only way you'll land in the strong arms of the Father who loves you ... the Father who catches you -- every time -- in the grip of his grace.</p></p><p>More than 120 million readers have found comfort in the writings of Max Lucado. He ministers at the Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, where he lives with his wife, Denalyn, and a sweet but misbehaving mutt, Andy.Popular writer and speaker Lucado here turns his interpretive powers on one of the most popular New Testament writings, the book of Romans, to probe the meaning of grace in Christian life. Using his own considerable storytelling powers, Lucado relates the biblical principles found in Romans to the stories of ordinary people like his father to fashion inspirational interpretations of the book of Romans for everyday life. Admitting that Romans is often difficult for Christians to read because of its focus on God's wrath and God's punishment of human sinfulness, Lucado translates and interprets the biblical texts to demonstrate that God's righteousness and justice are merely indicators of the mercy and lovingkindness inherent in God's grace. Through these readings, Lucado reminds readers of the eternal quality of God's mercy and the gentleness of his love. While Lucado's book is not a compendium of deep theological insights, his graceful style and his thorough exposition of biblical texts will grant rewards to interested readers. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Burning Maze (The Trials of Apollo Book 3) [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2018] Rick Riordan</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>First Poems of Childhood</h2><p>Tasha Tudor has illustrated with grace and delicacy this collection of favorite poems for the very young.

It is a time when world-renowned artist Rembrandt van Rijn is at the height of fame among his patrons--and when his young son Titus longs to imitate his father and become a great painter. At first, Rembrandt rebuffs Titus&#39;s attempts at drawing, telling the boy he is too young to learn art. But gradually, the master painter is won over by his son&#39;s enthusiasm and persistence, and he begins to teach a very happy Titus the basic techniques of drawing from life. Here is a warmhearted story for children, with illustrations that capture the atmosphere of seventeenth-century Holland and suggest some of the genius that radiates from Rembrandt&#39;s own magnificent paintings.</p><p>(back cover) <br> Titus dreamed of being an artist like his famous father, but his father didn�&#x2019;t think he was old enough to learn.

Heartful, cantankerous, droll, his tales of honour and obsession in the trade gratify the very book-love they portray. An irresistible read." <b>Dennis Lee</b><br><br>"An atmospheric, informative memoir by a Canadian seller of used and rare books ... Gossipy, rambling and enchanting, alive with Mason&#x2019;s love for books of every variety." <b>Kirkus Reviews</b><br><br>From his drug-hazy, book-happy years near the Beat Hotel in Paris and throughout his career as antiquarian book dealer, David Mason brings us a storied life. He discovers his love of literature in a bathtub at age eleven, thumbing through stacks of lurid Signet paperbacks. At fifteen he&#x2019;s expelled from school. For the next decade and a half, he will work odd jobs, buck all authority, buy books more often than food, and float around Europe. He&#x2019;ll help gild a volume in white morocco for Pope John XXIII. And then, at the age of 30, after returning home to Canada and apprenticing with Joseph Patrick Books, David Mason will find his calling.<br><br>Over the course of what is now a legendary international career, Mason shows unerring instincts for the logic of the trade. He makes good money from Canadian editions, both legitimate and pirated (turns out Canadian piracies so incensed Mark Twain that he moved to Montreal for six months to gain copyright protection). He outfoxes the cousins of L.M. Montgomery at auction and blackmails the head of the Royal Ontario Museum. He excoriates the bureaucratic pettiness that obstructs public acquisitions, he trumpets the ingenuity of collectors and scouts, and in archives around the world he appraises history in its unsifted and most moving forms. Above all, however, David Mason boldly campaigns for what he feels is the moral duty of the antiquarian trade: to preserve the history and traditions of all nations, and to assert without compromise that such histories have value. <br><br>Sly, sparkling, and endearingly gruff, <i>The Pope's Bookbinder</i> is an engrossing memoir by a giant in the book trade whose infectious enthusiasm, human insight, commercial shrewdness, and deadpan humour will delight bibliophiles for decades to come.<br></p><p>From his drug-hazy, book-happy years at the Beat Hotel in Spain to his present career as one of Canada&#39;s foremost antiquarian book dealers, David Mason has led a storied life - and whether he&#39;s crashed out on William Burroughs&#39; floor or gilding a white morocco for Pope John XXIII, Mason&#39;s humor and industry expertise is everywhere apparent.

And to pause whenever you feel your heart touched with devotion."<br><br>With these words of faith and wisdom as his guiding principle, Bert Ghezzi presents the lives of such familiar and beloved saints as Saint Peter and Saint Catherine of Siena; Saint Jerome and Saint Th�r�se of Lisieux; of humble, little-known figures like Felix of Nola, Pelagia the Penitent, and Leonard of Port Maurice; and of sainted men and women associated with a particular place, including Margaret of Scotland, Rose of Lima, Elizabeth Ann Seton, and Jun�pero Serra.&nbsp;&nbsp;In lively profiles written for contemporary readers, Ghezzi chronicles their journeys of faith and their contributions to the vitality of the Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices of the saints resound throughout the book, in quotations drawn from their own writings, the works of biographers, and the recollections of witnesses.<br><br>Readers can use <b>Voices of the Saints</b> in several different ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;Organized alphabetically, it serves as a helpful, easy-to-use dictionary.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also features a day-by-day numbering system, ideal for daily readings; notations at the end of each entry, enabling the exploration of the lives in historical order; an index that highlights particular themes (including the intriguing "Porcupine Saints"), and a calendar of saints' days.&nbsp;&nbsp;A fascinating look at disparate and unusual lives-each one a rich source of illumination, inspiration, encouragement, and motivation-along with prayers and meditations, Voices of the Saints is a valuable companion for members of Catholic, Episcopal, and other traditional churches, and an enlightening introduction to the saints for general readers.</p><p><i>The Voices of the Saints: A Year of Readings</i> by Bert Ghezzi begins with an epigraph drawn from the writings of St. Philip Neri: "The best preparation for prayer is to read the lives of the saints, not from mere curiosity, but quietly and with recollection a little at a time. And to pause whenever you feel your heart touched with devotion." Ghezzi's devotional has a fluid structure that will nourish any aspect of a reader's prayer life. Scores of short profiles of the saints (including familiar characters such as St. Peter and obscure saints such as Pelagia the Penitent) are deftly cross-referenced and indexed so that readers may pursue topical interests ("Angels," "Doubt," "Forgiveness," "Avant-Garde Saints") or explore the personal and historical connections among the saints. The readings are also numbered 1 through 365, for readers who prefer the discipline of a daily devotional (in this regard, <i>The Voices of the Saints</i> follows closely but not exhaustively the feast days of the Catholic liturgical calendar). Ghezzi's brief lives of the saints are complemented by well-chosen prayers and meditations drawn from the saints' writings. This book is a fine preparation for prayer, offering much to give the faithful reader pause.Advance praise for <b>Voices of the Saints</b>:<br><br>"If you are a 'saint watcher' this is the book for you, with a totally new arrangement permitting one to look up themes and calendars as well as the names of saints. This represents a unique step forward in biographies of the saints. The quotations supplied are also fascinating and worthwhile for meditation. A book to keep where you make your daily meditations." <br> -Fr. Benedict J.

After her mother leaves when Julia is nine years old, she's raised by an unassuming, gentle father and a saintly, matriarchal grandmother until her father dies just as Julia is becoming a young adult. <br>On the cusp of womanhood, Julia feels jaded by her circumstances and longs for a new identity. College seems like the perfect place to start over. But when Julia makes a mistake that will change her life forever, she returns to her grandmother's farm, defeated and convinced of her own worthlessness. Only through the gentle prodding of her loving grandmother does Julia begin to accept the imprint her childhood has left on her life and look for hope in a loving God who longs to make all things new.</p><p><b>Nicole Baart</b> was born and raised in Iowa, where she and her family now live. She taught high school English for several years in Canada but is now the full-time mother of two young sons and the wife of a pastor. After the Leaves Fall and its sequel, Summer Snow, are Nicole's first two novels. Visit her Web site [www.nicolebaart.com].In her promising debut novel, Baart writes compellingly about a young girl's struggle with loss, love, identity and faith. Julia Bakker knows what loss is. Her mother abandoned her, her beloved father died, and her childhood love has gone to college and found another. As a teen, she lives with her saintly grandmother, who urges her to go to church camp, but Julia finds only quick answers and thrilling conversions there. Disillusioned, Julia decides it is up to her, not anyone else-even some impossible, far-flung God-to reinvent herself. The truth was, I didn't know who I was, and I was afraid of being defined by who I wasn't. By what I didn't have.... By remembering with predictable, cyclic accuracy all I had lost. After chronicling her early years, the story follows Julia as she enrolls in college to study engineering and become someone who is too smart to attach, too independent to want to, and so secure as to be untouchable. Soon, Julia is repeating her mother's mistakes. The love of her rock-solid Christian grandmother and a newfound (and not completely well-explained) reliance on God help fortify her for the difficult path ahead. Sparkling prose makes this new novel a welcome addition to inspirational fiction. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her hair was the color of walnut wood. Her eyes were the color of bracken in October. Her socks were the color of cherries, which was noticeable because all the rest of her clothes were sad colors. She carried an enormous shoulder bag, canvas. It had a big buckle (square), but it was hanging open. The woman&#x2019;s mouth was open too. She was shifting from one foot to the other by the door so I told her to come in. The words came out a bit mangled due to the fact that I was wearing my mask. She asked what I&#x2019;d said, so I took it off and also took off my earmuffs and I said it again. She came in. Her socks were very red indeed. So was her face.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to be so rude, but I&#x2019;m gobsmacked.&#x201d; She did look it, to be honest. &#x201c;Did you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you didn&#x2019;t, did you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. make all these?&#x201d;</p><p>I told her yes.</p><p>&#x201c;Wow! I just can&#x2019;t believe it!&#x201d; she said, looking round.</p><p>I asked her why not.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s not exactly what you expect to find in the middle of nowhere! I&#x2019;ve been past the end of your lane so many times and I just had no idea that all this was here!&#x201d;</p><p>I put my earmuffs and mask on the workbench and informed her that indeed, all this was here. Perhaps I should have pointed out as well that this is not the middle of nowhere. Not at all. Exmoor is the most somewhere place that I know and my workshop is an extremely somewhere part of it. I did not say this, though. It would have been rude to contradict her.</p><p>Morning light was pouring in on us from the three windows. It outlined the sloping rafters. It floodlit the curls of wood shavings. It silvered the edges of the curves and arcs all around us and made strung shadows on the floor.</p><p>The woman was shaking her head so that the walnut-colored hair bounced around her face. &#x201c;How lovely! They&#x2019;re beautiful, so beautiful! It is like a scene from a fairy tale. And how strange that I&#x2019;ve stumbled across this place today of all days!&#x201d;</p><p>Today is Saturday, September 9, 2017. Is that a particularly strange day to stumble across a Harp Barn? I smiled politely. I wasn&#x2019;t sure if she wanted me to ask why it was strange. Lots of people find things strange that I don&#x2019;t find strange at all, and lots of people don&#x2019;t find strange the things that I find very strange indeed.</p><p>The woman kept looking at me and then gazing around the barn and then back at me again. Then she pulled on the strap of her canvas bag to rearrange it in a different way over her shoulder and said: &#x201c;Do you mind my asking, have you been here long?&#x201d;</p><p>I informed her that I&#x2019;d been here for one hour and forty-three minutes. Before that I was out in the woods, having my walk. She smiled and said: &#x201c;No, I mean, have you had this place a long time? As a workshop?&#x201d;</p><p>I told her I came here when I was ten years old and I was now thirty-three years old, so that meant (I explained in case her math was not very good) that I&#x2019;d been here for twenty-three years.</p><p>&#x201c;No! I just can&#x2019;t believe it!&#x201d; she said again. She seemed to have a problem believing things. She shook her head slowly. &#x201c;I think I must be in a dream.&#x201d;</p><p>I offered to pinch her.</p><p>She laughed. Her laugh was interesting: explosive and a little bit snorty.</p><p>The next thing that happened was I went across and shook her hand because that is what you are supposed to do.

What a lot of things are embedded in that housewife word.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s funny,&#x201d; she mused, her eyes wandering around the barn again. &#x201c;Harp playing was on my list.&#x201d;</p><p>I asked if she meant her shopping list.</p><p>She paused and looked at me with arched eyebrows. &#x201c;No, my before-forty list.

Like swimming with dolphins and seeing the Great Wall of China.&#x201d;</p><p>I asked if she had swum with dolphins and she said no. I asked if she had seen the Great Wall of China and she said no. Then she added that she had a few years to go yet. I asked her how many, but she didn&#x2019;t answer. Perhaps I shouldn&#x2019;t have asked her that. There are lots of things you are not supposed to ask, and I fear that might be one of them. So I changed my question and asked her what would happen if she didn&#x2019;t manage to swim with dolphins or see the Great Wall of China or play the harp before she reached the age of forty. She said, &#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>We were silent for a bit.</p><p>&#x201c;It smells lovely in here,&#x201d; she commented finally. &#x201c;I love the smell of wood.&#x201d;</p><p>I was glad she had noticed it because most people don&#x2019;t, and I was glad that she appreciated it because most people don&#x2019;t. Then she gestured toward the harps. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re utterly exquisite,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Will you tell me something about them?&#x201d;</p><p>I told her yes. I informed her that they are Celtic-style traditional harps and they would have been fairly widespread in Britain during the Middle Ages, especially in the north and west. I told her I had carved the Elfin from my own design out of the sycamore tree that had fallen by the brook four years ago. I mentioned that I had made the Sylvan from ancient beech and the Linnet from rosewood. I showed her the drawers of strings and explained about the red ones being Cs, the black ones being Fs and the white ones being As, Bs, Ds, Es and Gs. I told her about each one being a different thickness and the importance of tension. I showed her the holes in the back and how they were anchored inside. I explained the use of the levers for sharpening the note. I told her about the pebbles. I gave her a couple of pieces of wood so that she could hold them and compare the weight. I expanded on the different resonances of different woods.</p><p>Then I realized that I had not asked very much about her, so I stopped telling her things and I asked the following eight questions: How are you? Do you have any pets? What is in your enormous shoulder bag? What is your favorite color? What is your favorite tree? Where do you live? Do you enjoy being the Exmoor Housewife? Would you like a sandwich?</p><p>She answered me the following answers: fine, thank you; no; a big camera and a notepad and a thermos with soup; red; birch; about five miles southwest of here; um; that would be very nice.</p><p>I made twelve sandwiches using six slices of bread and substantial quantities of cream cheese. I cut them into triangles because I reckoned she was a lady.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve noticed that the act of cutting always helps me think. I do some good thinking when I cut up wood to make harps too. That might have been why, over the triangles of the sandwiches, I came to a decision.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>Ellie</p><p>&#x201c;He gave you one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just like that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, pretty much.&#x201d;</p><p>Clive lowered the motoring magazine and transferred his full attention to my face. His eyebrows drew together and two deep vertical creases appeared between them.</p><p>&#x201c;I presume you&#x2019;re having me on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, and added a &#x201c;Not&#x201d; to underline it.</p><p>&#x201c;So he offered, and you just took it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it was&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was hard to say no.&#x201d;</p><p>This was going to be tricky. I couldn&#x2019;t explain it to myself, let alone offer an explanation to anyone else. Which was why I&#x2019;d been driving around Exmoor for the last half hour&#x2014;with frequent stops to look in the back of the car and check that it was true&#x2014;before I finally headed homeward.</p><p>Our nice but nosy neighbor Pauline was out in her garden, so I had gone straight in. I had launched myself into the kitchen. I&#x2019;d swept a brief kiss into my husband&#x2019;s receding hairline. I&#x2019;d sought out the kettle, filled it to the brim, spurted myself with water in the process and abandoned it. Then I&#x2019;d blurted out a tangle of sentences that sounded frothy and ridiculous. I&#x2019;d blushed, become aware of it, and blushed some more. Now I stood limply grinning by the fridge.</p><p>Clive closed the magazine and tugged at the neck of his sweatshirt. &#x201c;Sorry, El, but I have to ask: Exactly how long have you known this man?&#x201d;</p><p>My mind traveled back to the strange encounter of earlier: the huge open door of the barn that had enticed me in, the warm scent of wood, the light falling on the myriad harps, and there, in the center of them all, the lone figure. There had been some sort of tool in his hand, but already my memory was playing tricks on me and I couldn&#x2019;t say what it was. He had initially appeared to be an alien. His lower face was covered by some sort of blue mask and he was wearing earmuffs, presumably protection from sawdust and machinery noise. But the minute he&#x2019;d taken them off, I was struck by the beauty of the man. He was tall and sinewy with dark, disheveled hair. Although his skin looked weather-beaten, there was a strange translucent quality about it. His face was classically sculpted, as if a great deal of thought had gone into every line and curve. But it was his huge, dark eyes that really claimed my curiosity. I&#x2019;d never seen eyes like that before.</p><p>&#x201c;I only met him the first time this morning.&#x201d;</p><p>Clive was as nonplussed as I&#x2019;d been an hour earlier. He leaned forward, his expression wavering between amusement and disbelief. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get it.&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed manically. Explanations swam round in my head, but not one of them was managing to formulate itself into words.</p><p>Clive was clearly preparing to escort me to the nearest asylum.</p><p>&#x201c;Come and look,&#x201d; I tried. Once he saw it, surely he would be as enthusiastic as I was?</p><p>I led him outside into the bright chill of the September air. Pauline, I gratefully noticed, had disappeared. The car was still unlocked. I flung open the rear door. Clive&#x2019;s eyes nearly popped out of his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Ah!&#x201d; I cried in a voice that was half irony, half relief. &#x201c;So I wasn&#x2019;t hallucinating!&#x201d;</p><p>It&#x2019;s a good thing we have a hatchback and seats that go down. I stood back to allow my husband a thorough examination.</p><p>The harp was carved out of red-gold wood (cherry, Dan had told me, to go with my socks). It had a lovely soft sheen and there was a marbled swirl in the graining at the joint where it would rest against my shoulder. A light Celtic pattern was carved along the sweep of the neck, and embedded in the wood at the crest was a shiny blue-black pebble. Apparently Dan always puts an Exmoor pebble into his harps. Each pebble is carefully chosen to complement the style and character of the instrument. This harp&#x2014;my harp&#x2014;was a lovely size, just as high as my waistline when it was standing. Now it was lying on one side, nestled cozily on the tartan rug in the back of the car.</p><p>Clive knocked at the wood of the soundboard with his knuckles as if to check it was real. &#x201c;But this is quality craftsmanship!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I said, smug now, almost proud of Dan. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been making them all his life.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This would cost&#x2014;what&#x2014;two thousand pounds? Three? More, even, if it&#x2019;s all handmade. Look at the carving along the top.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The neck. It&#x2019;s called the neck. Apparently.&#x201d;</p><p>Clive was scrutinizing as only Clive can scrutinize. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s&#x2014;well, I have to say it&#x2019;s pretty cool! But, honeybun, there&#x2019;s no way you can keep it. You do know that, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>The voice of logic. It came hurtling through my haze of surreal, heady joy, and it stung. &#x201c;Of course I do,&#x201d; I mumbled.</p><p>Clive straightened and shook his head. &#x201c;The guy must be insane.&#x201d;</p><p>I sprang to his defense. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s definitely not insane. But he&#x2019;s a little&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unusual.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a cert! What could have possessed him? A woman he doesn&#x2019;t know from Adam comes waltzing into his workshop one day and, on the spur of the moment, he decides to give her&#x2014;to give her&#x2014;nothing less than a harp. A handmade harp that took him God knows how long to construct. Sell, fair enough, I could understand sell, but give? Even the materials must have set him back a bit. Come on, hon, get real! You must have misunderstood. He must have meant you to pay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, he didn&#x2019;t. He made that quite clear.&#x201d;</p><p>Clive frowned, unable to comprehend such a concept. &#x201c;Well then, I guess he gave it to you to try out, hoping for a sale, and you completely got the wrong end of the stick.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t! Look, I told him about fifteen times I couldn&#x2019;t possibly accept it. He just didn&#x2019;t get it. He kept asking why not&#x2014;and he was so&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t know, so open, so well-meaning, that I felt stupid and couldn&#x2019;t think of an answer. Then he said, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t you like the harp?&#x2019; He sounded really hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He sounded hurt? El, I think you&#x2019;re pushing it a bit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I swear it&#x2019;s true! And then he started pacing through the barn, hunting for another, better one to give me! So I had to tell him it was a lovely harp. I had to tell him I loved the harp. And it&#x2019;s true. How could I not? But I said again and again I&#x2019;d never be able to play it and it would be wasted on me, and I kept on protesting.&#x201d; I leaned over and gazed lovingly at my gift. &#x201c;While I was protesting he just carried it to the car and put it in.&#x201d;</p><p>My mind leaped back again. I had felt so touched by the man&#x2019;s extraordinary gesture. I had not been able to resist plucking a few strings, as the harp lay there on its side in my car. I did it badly, of course, never having done such a thing in my life before, but the sound was rich, wild and resonant. It had a strange effect, like a shower of golden sparks soaring inside me.</p><p>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; Dan had said. &#x201c;You can cross it off your list now.&#x201d; He had walked quickly back into the barn and shut the door behind him.</p><p>I had stared at the door for a long time.</p><p>Today, of all days. After all my wandering and crying and remembering.</p><p>Clive&#x2019;s voice jolted me back to the present. &#x201c;Look, El, I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s going to have to go back.&#x201d;</p><p>The words bore down on me with their dull weight of common sense. Of course he hadn&#x2019;t realized what day it was today, and what that meant for me. I probably should have reminded him, but my stubborn streak wouldn&#x2019;t let me.</p><p>&#x201c;I know. You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; I said, trying to sound as if I didn&#x2019;t care.</p><p>He was rubbing a hand over his brow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to buy it for you, hon, really I would. But it would be way too pricey. And you&#x2019;d get bored of it pretty soon anyway. You&#x2019;ve never shown any interest in playing a musical instrument before, after all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And we can&#x2019;t be in this man&#x2019;s debt. It would be taking advantage.&#x201d;</p><p>I put my hand on his arm. &#x201c;I know it would. I never should have accepted. I&#x2019;m sorry I was so stupid. It was one of those crazy moments. I don&#x2019;t know what came over me.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Fahrenheit 451 - The Illustrated Man - Dandelion Wine - The Golden Apples of the Sun &amp; the Martian Chronicles</h2><p>Complete and Unabridged: Fahrenheit 451 The Illustrated Man Dandelion Wine The Golden Apples of the Sun The Martian Chronicles</p><p></p><h2>Creative Beading</h2><p>Creative Beading is a fine addition to any beader&#x2019;s library.

It was clear that the primary battlefield would be the open ocean&#x2014;but America's war fleet, only twenty ships strong, faced a practiced British navy of more than a thousand men-of-war. Still, through a combination of nautical deftness and sheer bravado, the American navy managed to take the fight to the British and turn the tide of the war: on the Great Lakes, in the Atlantic, and even in the eastern Pacific.<p> In <i>1812: The Navy's War</i>, prizewinning historian George C. Daughan tells the thrilling story of how a handful of heroic captains and their stalwart crews overcame spectacular odds to lead the country to victory against the world's greatest imperial power. A stunning contribution to military and national history, <i>1812: The Navy's War</i> is the first complete account in more than a century of how the U.S. Navy rescued the fledgling nation and secured America's future.</p></p><p><b>George C. Daughan</b> holds a Ph.D. in American history and government from Harvard University and won the 2008 Samuel Eliot Morison Award for his previous book, <i>If By Sea</i>. He resides in Portland, Maine.&#x201c;Other authors in the recent past have covered various aspects of the War of 1812, but George C. Daughan has put it all together in one well-written and interesting volume. It&#x2019;s a book hard to put down and is most highly recommended as a good read. Its coverage of an important time in the history of the United States will make it a worthy reference for years to come.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>American Spirit<br></i></b>&#x201c;The fledgling U.S. Navy had advantages that would surprise, infuriate and ultimately impress the British, as renowned naval military historian George C.

Forester&#x2019;s Hornblower tales or Patrick O&#x2019; Brian&#x2019;s stories of Captain Jack Aubrey will enjoy this narrative of the American side of the Napoleonic wars and thrill to the progress of an underdog along the route to world power.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>1812: The Navy&#x2019;s</i> War is an important, well-researched and timely book &#x2013; next year marks the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812 &#x2013; which scholars and lay persons alike will enjoy for its descriptions of the battles and Daughan&#x2019;s analysis of the domestic and international dimensions of the war.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br><b><i>Charleston</i></b><b><i> Post and Courier<br></i></b>&#x201c;George C.

With painstaking attention to detail and the ability to make complex naval confrontations understandable, even gripping, Daughan pursues the war north to the St. Lawrence River, east to the British coast where American privateers harassed British shipping, and south to New Orleans.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>The Advocate </i>(Baton Rouge)<br></b>&#x201c;[A] deep and detailed page-turner of a book.

But if a compulsion to concentrate excessively on the more spectacular bits and pieces of the conflict has been an endemic problem among academics and writers, this volume is an antidote. Daughan not only thoroughly illuminates the emotion-triggering events of the conflict; he also adds the background that connects the highlights. That background includes, for example, the American and British domestic politics and diplomacy, which were continuously both cause and effect in the process.&#x201d;</p><b><i>The Providence Journal</i></b>:</p><h2>Black Girls Must Die Exhausted: A Novel for Grown Ups</h2><p>&#x201c;Black girls must die exhausted&#x201d; is something that 33-year-old Tabitha Walker has heard her grandmother say before. Of course, her grandmother (who happens to be white) was referring to the 1950&#x2019;s and what she observed in the nascent times of civil rights. With a coveted position as a local news reporter, Marc-- a &#x201c;paper-perfect&#x201d; boyfriend, and a standing Saturday morning appointment with a reliable hairstylist, Tabitha never imagined how this phrase could apply to her as a black girl in contemporary times &#x2013; until everything changed.An unexpected doctor&#x2019;s diagnosis awakens Tabitha to an unperceived culprit, threatening the one thing that has always mattered most - having a family of her own. With the help of her best friends, the irreverent and headstrong Laila and Alexis, the former &#x201c;Sexy Lexi," Tabitha must explore the reaches of modern medicine and test the limits of her relationships to beat the ticking clock on her dreams of becoming a wife and mother.She must leverage the power of laughter, love, and courageous self-care to bring a healing stronger than she ever imagined - before the phrase &#x201c;black girls must die exhausted&#x201d; takes on a new and unwanted meaning in her own life.</p><p>I wrote <i>Black Girls Must Die Exhausted</i> to show that love is the language that we all speak and the very lifeblood of our existence.&nbsp; Love comes in many forms-- self-love, love between friends, familial love and romantic love, amongst them.&nbsp; In fact, this book itself <i>is</i> my <i>love letter</i> - to you, to black women, to women and to all those who understand the beauty that comes through struggle and the benefit of doing their own work to heal, to understand, to grow, and most importantly, to love more fully.<br><br>Quality Black Books, the publisher of <i>Black Girls</i>, or BGMDE (my preference for an abbreviated reference), was established to provide a necessary expansion of the traditional publishing industry.&nbsp; There is a need for more diverse voices in literature with the freedom and leeway to write undiluted perspectives for more diverse audiences.&nbsp; Quality Black Books is that leeway and that conduit between an overlooked audience of readers and the books they'd like to see more of.&nbsp; We don't just need more diverse books, we need more diverse perspectives with the expectation and acknowledgment of a more diverse audience.&nbsp;<br><br>Much thanks and appreciation to everyone who played a role in the creation and success of this book: to our team of remarkable editors tirelessly proofing for misplaced commas, to our early readers providing feedback <i>and</i> pushback when necessary, and to the incredible artists who contributed to the visual representation of the words and ideas of the story - you are appreciated!&nbsp;Jayne Allen is a black girl from Detroit who smiles widely, laughs loudly and loves to tell stories that stick to your bones. Her debut novel, "Black Girls Must Die Exhausted," which Kirkus Reviews called "both timely and enjoyable," touches upon contemporary women's issues such as workplace womanhood, race, fertility, modern relationships and mental health awareness, echoing her desire to bring both multiculturalism and multidimensionality to contemporary women's fiction with dynamic female protagonists who also happen to be black.

We feel an emotional response, but the work still seems to evade our understanding.<br><br>Francoise Barbe-Gall combines a nuanced understanding of the way viewers respond to paintings with a rich knowledge of their context and circumstances of their creation. The result is like a tour of a dazzlingly eclectic museum in the company of a gentle yet authoritative guide.<br><br>She takes as her point of departure the impressions that we all feel when confronted by a canvas and takes us on a voyage of discovery fired by her own passionate enthusiasm for the subject. What is the painting&#x2019;s relationship with the real world? Has the artist idealized nature, or distorted it? Did they want to shock the viewer, or provide consolation? With a clear approach and straightforward yet subtle analysis, the meaning of each work slowly becomes clear.<br><br>From Raphael&#x2019;s penetrating character study of Castiglione, through Hopper&#x2019;s cinematic take on the wee small hours of the morning Barbe-Gall begins by covering a number of ostensibly realistic works, made from the stuff of everyday life. Going in quite the other direction, she looks at the way paintings can express moments of heightened reality, from the perfection of Boticelli&#x2019;s Primavera to the arresting glance of Vermeer&#x2019;s girl with the Pearl Earring. She discusses paintings that distort the visible world (Parmigianino&#x2019;s Madonna with an improbably long neck to Dali&#x2019;s melting clocks) and those that sow confusion to make us more vigilant and pay closer attention to the real world (Cezanne&#x2019;s depiction of a forest glade, or a mysterious fifteenth century altarpiece). Questions of history, style, iconography and composition are not neglected and are dealt in context of the paintings she discusses.</p></p><p><p><b>Fran�oise Barbe-Gall</b> studied history of art at the Sorbonne and also at the Ecole du Louvre, where she now teaches.

Hoping to ignite a passion for math in his own kids, he has crafted a smart and action-packed story for middle-grade readers that uses math lessons to solve the mystery. He and his wife and their children live in New York City.<p></p>Grade 6&#x2013;8&#x2014;This clever and unusual mystery is tailor made for young mathematicians. Lady Di and Tom Jones live in Folsom Adjacent, a godforsaken trailer park named after the giant power plant that shares the small coastal island. When people start vanishing from this nuclear nowhere, the two 11-year-olds investigate, using mathematical cues left behind by their missing math tutor. Equations, right triangles, pi, coordinates, and slope help the kids and some of their similarly outcast friends negotiate a massive maze of underground tunnels to access the plant and discover a nefarious scheme that will destroy the island. Carey is particularly adept at creating setting: the landscape is raw, desolate, and nearly apocalyptic. Math moves the plot along, at times at the expense of character development. Replete with diagrams, charts, and illustrated problems, the book will appeal especially to kids who love geometry, but it will also reel in fans of less numbers-centric books such as Eric Berlin's <i>The Puzzling World of Winston Breen</i> (Putnam, 2007) or Ellen Raskin's <i>The Westing Game</i> (Puffin, 1992).&#x2014;<i>Connie Tyrrell Burns, Mahoney Middle School, South Portland, ME</i> END</p><h2>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Sterling Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>Robert Ingpen's lush interpretation of L.

The Stratofortress entered active service in 1955 and is scheduled to continue as part of the air force's inventory through 2040. The jet-powered bomber was a mainstay of America's Cold War nuclear-deterrent strategy, providing air power that balanced the land and sea military forces. The massive plane also served as the launch platform for the experimental X-15 hypersonic rocket aircraft. Due to its versatility as an aircraft, the B-52 has seen combat service in all of America's military conflicts since it came on active duty: Vietnam, the first and second Gulf wars, and the War in Afghanistan.&nbsp;<i>B-52 </i><i>Stratofortress </i>also covers every aspect of the aircraft's development, manufacture, and modification. These technical details set the stage for its military service, starting with its role as a nuclear bomber in the Cold War even though only conventional weapons have been used during its combat duty. The airplane&#x2019;s service in key campaigns in Vietnam is covered, followed by the quieter years after it. The B-52 returned to prominence in the Gulf Wars and Afghanistan, taking part in massive bombing campaigns in both conflicts. Finally, the book ends with the constant &nbsp;upgrades that will keep the B-52 an integral part of U.S. airpower for decades to come.<p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>&nbsp;</p>In 1954, Secretary of the Air Force Donald Quarles looked up at the immense Boeing B-52 Stratofortress and described it as &#x201c;the most formidable expression of air power in the history of military aviation.&#x201d;&nbsp;Much the same could still be said today.&nbsp;No other combat aircraft has remained in first-line service as long as the B-52. The Stratofortress first took off with the U.S. Air Force Strategic Air Command in the Cold War 1950s, ready to deliver nuclear strikes at any time and any place in the world. It would remain on alert for that possibility until 1991, in addition to flying conventional bombing missions over Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s. In the 1990s, it flew conventional bombing missions against targets in Iraq and the Balkans. In 2001, nearing its fiftieth anniversary, the B-52 began punishing al-Qaeda terrorists hiding in Afghan caves.&nbsp;Bill Yenne, author of <i>The American Aircraft Factory in World War II</i>, covers the whole story, from the strategic needs that called for a new bomber to the drawing board, the flight tests, and decades of operations and upgrades that have kept the B-52 going strong into a new century. He illustrates this one-of-a-kind story with more than 200 eye-catching photos from throughout the B-52&#x2019;s history.&nbsp;Finally, <i>B-52 Stratofortress</i> looks to the future. With continuing upgrades, the U.S. Air Force expects to keep the B-52 flying through the middle of this century, a stunning <i>nine decades </i>since the first model entered operational service.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>The Boeing B-52 Stratofortress&#x2014;it&#x2019;s an epic aircraft, the longest-serving combat aircraft in the U.S. Air Force. Known as the BUFF (standing for <i>Big Ugly Fat Fellow</i>), it entered operational service in 1955 and is slated to continue as a vital part of the USAF inventory through the middle of the twenty-first century, giving it an unprecedented &nbsp;ninety years of front-line service. From its beginning, the&nbsp;B-52 was a mainstay of America&#x2019;s Cold War nuclear deterrent, the manned bomber that augmented land-based and submarine-based missile forces. Due to its extreme versatility, dependability, and low operating costs, it has seen combat service in all of America&#x2019;s hot wars since 1965: Vietnam, both Gulf Wars, and the war in Afghanistan.&nbsp; In <i>B-52 Stratofortress</i>, Bill Yenne covers every aspect of the BUFF&#x2019;s development, manufacture, modification, and combat service. This six-decade success story is illustrated with over 200 photographs, providing a rich historic overview of this aviation and military icon.<p></p></p><h2>Starring Miss Barbara Stanwyck [Illustrated with 310 Photographs]</h2><p>Reviews Miss Stanwyck&#39;s show business career and includes movie stills and publicity shots as well as comments by critics, directors, and producers</p><p></p><h2>A Most Wanted Man</h2><p>&nbsp;Tommy Brue has inherited a doomed private British bank based in Hamburg.

At the age of twenty he was in his own small world a celebrity, and not only for his prowess in the boxing ring: elected youth representative of his Islamic sports club, three times runner-up in the North German Championship hundred-meter butterfly stroke and, as if all that weren&#x2019;t enough, star goalkeeper of his Saturday soccer team.<br> <br>Like most very large people, he was also more accustomed to being looked at than looking, which is another reason why the skinny boy got away with shadowing him for three successive days and nights.<br> <br>The two men first made eye contact as Melik and his mother, Leyla, emerged from the al-Umma Travel Shop, fresh from buying air tickets for Melik&#x2019;s sister&#x2019;s wedding in their home village outside Ankara. Melik felt someone&#x2019;s gaze fixed on him, glanced round and came face-to-face with a tall, desperately thin boy of his own height with a straggly beard, eyes reddened and deep-set, and a long black coat that could have held three magicians. He had a black-and-white kaffiyeh round his neck and a tourist&#x2019;s camel-skin saddlebag slung over his shoulder. He stared at Melik, then at Leyla. Then he came back to Melik, never blinking, but appealing to him with his fiery, sunken eyes.<br> <br>Yet the boy&#x2019;s air of desperation need not have troubled Melik all that much since the travel shop was situated at the edge of the main railway station concourse, where every variety of lost soul&#x2014;German vagrants, Asians, Arabs, Africans, and Turkish like himself but less fortunate&#x2014;hung around all day long, not to mention legless men on electric carts, drug sellers and their customers, beggars and their dogs, and a seventy-year-old cowboy in a Stetson and silver-studded leather riding breeches. Few had work, and a sprinkling had no business standing on German soil at all, but were at best tolerated under a deliberate policy of destitution, pending their summary deportation, usually at dawn. Only new arrivals or the willfully foolhardy took the risk. Cannier illegals gave the station a wide berth.<br> <br>A further good reason to ignore the boy was the classical music that the station authorities boom at full blast over this section of the concourse from a battery of well-aimed loudspeakers. Its purpose, far from spreading feelings of peace and well-being among its listeners, is to send them packing.<br> <br>Despite these impediments the skinny boy&#x2019;s face imprinted itself on Melik&#x2019;s consciousness and for a fleeting moment he felt embarrassed by his own happiness. Why on earth should he? Something splendid had just occurred, and he couldn&#x2019;t wait to phone his sister and tell her that their mother, Leyla, after six months of tending her dying husband, and a year of mourning her heart out for him, was bubbling over with pleasure at the prospect of attending her daughter&#x2019;s wedding, and fussing about what to wear, and whether the dowry was big enough, and the groom as handsome as everybody, including Melik&#x2019;s sister, said he was.<br> <br>So why shouldn&#x2019;t Melik chatter along with his own mother? Which he did, enthusiastically, all the way home. It was the skinny boy&#x2019;s stillness, he decided later. Those lines of age in a face as young as mine. His look of winter on a lovely spring day.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>That was the Thursday.<br> <br>And on the Friday evening, when Melik and Leyla came out of mosque together, there he was again, the same boy, the same kaffiyeh and outsized overcoat, huddled in the shadow of a grimy doorway. This time Melik noticed that there was a sideways list to his skinny body, as if he&#x2019;d been knocked off true and remained at that angle until somebody told him he could straighten up. And the fiery stare burning even more brightly than on the previous day. Melik met his gaze head-on, wished he hadn&#x2019;t and looked away.<br> <br>And this second encounter was all the less probable because Leyla and Melik scarcely ever went to mosque, not even a moderate Turkish-language one. Since 9/11, Hamburg&#x2019;s mosques had become dangerous places. Go to the wrong one, or the right one and get the wrong imam, and you could find yourself and your family on a police watch list for the rest of your life. Nobody doubted that practically every prayer row contained an informant who was earning his way with the authorities. Nobody was likely to forget, be he Muslim, police spy or both, that the city-state of Hamburg had been unwitting host to three of the 9/11 hijackers, not to mention their fellow cell-members and plotters; or that Mohammed Atta, who steered the first plane into the Twin Towers, had worshiped his wrathful god in a humble Hamburg mosque.<br> <br>It was also a fact that since her husband&#x2019;s death Leyla and her son had become less observant of their faith. Yes, of course the old man had been a Muslim, and a laic too. But he was a militant supporter of workers&#x2019; rights, which was why he had been driven out of his homeland. The only reason they had gone to mosque at all was that Leyla in her impulsive way had felt a sudden need. She was happy. The weight of her grief was lifting. Yet the first anniversary of her husband&#x2019;s death was approaching. She needed to have a dialogue with him and share the good news. They had already missed the main Friday prayer, and could just as well have prayed at home. But Leyla&#x2019;s whim was law. Arguing correctly that personal invocations stand a better chance of being heard if they are offered in the evening, she had insisted on attending the last prayer hour of the day, which incidentally meant that the mosque was as good as empty.<br> <br>So clearly Melik&#x2019;s second encounter with the skinny boy, like the first, was mere chance. For what else could it be? Or so, in his plain way, the good-hearted Melik reasoned.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>The next day being a Saturday, Melik took a bus across town to visit his affluent paternal uncle at the family candle factory. Relationships between his uncle and his father had at times been strained, but since his father&#x2019;s death he had learned to respect his uncle&#x2019;s friendship. Jumping aboard the bus, whom should he see but the skinny boy sitting below him in the glass shelter, watching him depart? And six hours later, when he returned to the same bus stop, the boy was still there, wrapped in his kaffiyeh and magician&#x2019;s overcoat, crouched in the same corner of the shelter, waiting.<br> <br>At the sight of him Melik, who as a rule of life was pledged to love all mankind equally, was seized by an uncharitable aversion. He felt that the skinny boy was accusing him of something and he resented it. Worse, there was an air of superiority about him, despite his miserable condition. What did he think he was achieving with that ridiculous black coat, anyway? That it made him invisible or something? Or was he trying to imply that he was so unfamiliar with our Western ways that he had no idea of the image he created?<br> <br>Either way, Melik determined to shake him off. So instead of going up to him and asking him whether he needed help, or was ill, which in other circumstances he might have done, he struck out for home at full stride, confident that the skinny boy stood no chance of keeping up with him.<br> <br>The day was unseasonably hot for spring, and the sun was beating off the crowded pavement. Yet the skinny boy contrived by some kind of miracle to keep pace with Melik, limping and panting, wheezing and sweating, and now and then jumping in the air as if in pain, but still managing to draw up alongside him at pedestrian crossings.<br> <br>And when Melik let himself into the tiny brick house that, after decades of family scrimping, his mother now owned almost free of debt, he had only to wait a few breaths before the front doorbell chimed its carillon. And when he returned downstairs, there stood the skinny boy on the doorstep with his saddlebag over his shoulder and his eyes blazing from the effort of the walk, and sweat pouring down his face like summer rain, and in his trembling hand he held a piece of brown cardboard on which was written in Turkish: I am a Muslim medical student. I am tired and I wish to stay in your house. Issa. And as if to ram the message home, round his wrist a bracelet of fine gold, and dangling from it, a tiny gold replica of the Koran.<br> <br>But Melik by now had a full head of outrage. All right, he wasn&#x2019;t the greatest intellect his school had ever seen but he objected to feeling guilty and inferior, and being followed and preyed upon by a beggar with attitude. When his father died Melik had proudly assumed the role of master of the house and his mother&#x2019;s protector and, as a further assertion of his authority, done what his father had not succeeded in doing before his death: as a second-generation Turkish resident, he had launched himself and his mother on the long, stony road to German citizenship, where every aspect of a family&#x2019;s lifestyle was taken under the microscope, and eight years of unblemished behavior were the first prerequisite. The last thing he or his mother needed was some deranged vagrant claiming to be a medical student and begging on their doorstep.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get the hell out of here,&#x201d; he ordered the skinny boy roughly in Turkish, shaping up to him in the doorway. &#x201c;Get out of here, stop following us and don&#x2019;t come back.&#x201d;<br> <br>Meeting no reaction from the haggard face except a wince as if it had been struck, Melik repeated his instruction in German. But when he made to slam the door, he discovered Leyla standing on the stair behind him, looking over his shoulder at the boy and at the cardboard notice shaking uncontrollably in his hand.<br> <br>And he saw that she already had tears of pity in her eyes.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Sunday passed and on the Monday morning Melik found excuses not to show up at his cousin&#x2019;s greengrocery business in Wellingsb�ttel. He must stay home and train for the Amateur Open Boxing Championship, he told his mother. He must work out in the gym and in the Olympic pool. But in reality he had decided she was not safe to be left alone with an elongated psycho with delusions of grandeur who, when he wasn&#x2019;t praying or staring at the wall, prowled about the house, fondly touching everything as if he remembered it from long ago. Leyla was a peerless woman, in her son&#x2019;s judgment, but since her husband&#x2019;s death volatile and guided solely by her feelings. Those whom she chose to love could do no wrong. Issa&#x2019;s softness of manner, his timidity and sudden rushes of dawning happiness, made him an instant member of that select company.<br> <br>On the Monday and again on the Tuesday, Issa did little except sleep, pray and bathe himself. To communicate he spoke broken Turkish with a peculiar, guttural accent, furtively, in bursts, as though talking were forbidden, and yet still in some unfathomable way, to Melik&#x2019;s ear, didactic. Otherwise he ate. Where on earth did he put all that food? At any hour of the day, Melik would walk into the kitchen and there he was, head bowed over a bowl of lamb and rice and vegetables, spoon never still, eyes slipping from side to side lest somebody snatch his food away. When he&#x2019;d finished, he&#x2019;d wipe the bowl clean with a piece of bread, eat the bread and, with a muttered &#x201c;Thanks be to God&#x201d; and a faint smirk on his face as if he had a secret that was too good to share with them, take the bowl to the sink and wash it under the tap, a thing Leyla would never in a month of Sundays have allowed her own son or husband to do. The kitchen was her domain. Men keep out.<br> <br>&#x201c;So when are you reckoning to start your medical studies, Issa?&#x201d; Melik asked him casually, in his mother&#x2019;s hearing.<br> <br>&#x201c;God willing, it will be soon. I must be strong. I must not be beggar.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need a residence permit, you know. And a student&#x2019;s ID. Not to mention like a hundred thousand euros for board and lodging. And a neat little two-seater to take your girlfriends out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;God is all-merciful. When I am not beggar, He will provide.&#x201d;<br> <br>Such self-assurance went beyond mere piety in Melik&#x2019;s view.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s costing us real money, Mother,&#x201d; he declared, barging into the kitchen while Issa was safely in the attic. &#x201c;The way he eats. All those baths.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No more than you, Melik.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, but he&#x2019;s not me, is he? We don&#x2019;t know who he is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Issa is our guest. When he is restored to health, with Allah&#x2019;s help we shall consider his future,&#x201d; his mother replied loftily.<br> <br>Issa&#x2019;s implausible efforts at self-effacement only made him more conspicuous in Melik&#x2019;s eyes. Sidling his way down the cramped corridor, or preparing to climb the stepladder to the attic where Leyla had made up a bed for him, he employed what Melik regarded as exaggerated circumspection, seeking permission with his doe eyes, and flattening himself against the wall when Melik or Leyla needed to pass.<br> <br>&#x201c;Issa has been in prison,&#x201d; Leyla announced complacently one morning.<br> <br>Melik was appalled. &#x201c;Do you know that for a fact? We&#x2019;re harboring a jailbird? Do the police know that for a fact? Did he tell you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He said that in prison in Istanbul they give only one piece of bread and a bowl of rice a day,&#x201d; said Leyla, and before Melik could protest any more, added one of her late husband&#x2019;s favorite nostrums: &#x201c;We honor the guest and go to the assistance of those in distress. No work of charity will go unrewarded in Paradise,&#x201d; she intoned. &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t your own father in prison in Turkey, Melik? Not everyone who goes to prison is a criminal. For people like Issa and your father, prison is a badge of honor.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Melik knew she had other thoughts up her sleeve that she was less inclined to reveal. Allah had answered her prayers. He had sent her a second son to make up for the husband she had lost. The fact that he was an illegal half-crazed jailbird with delusions about himself was of no apparent interest to her.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>He was from Chechnya.<br> <br>That much they established on the third evening when Leyla astonished them both by trilling out a couple of sentences of Chechen, a thing Melik never in his life had heard her do. Issa&#x2019;s haggard face lit up with a sudden amazed smile that vanished equally quickly, and thereafter he seemed to be struck mute. Yet Leyla&#x2019;s explanation of her linguistic skills turned out to be simple. As a young girl in Turkey she had played with Chechen children in her village and picked up snippets of their language. She guessed Issa was Chechen from the moment she set eyes on him but kept her counsel because with Chechens you never knew.<br> <br>He was from Chechnya, and his mother was dead and all he had to remember her by was the golden bracelet with the Koran attached to it that she had placed round his wrist before she died. But when she died and how she died, and how old he was when he inherited her bracelet were questions he either failed to understand or didn&#x2019;t wish to.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chechens are hated everywhere,&#x201d; Leyla explained to Melik, while Issa kept his head down and went on eating. &#x201c;But not by us. Do you hear me, Melik?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I hear you, Mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone persecutes Chechens except us,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;It is normal all over Russia and the world. Not only Chechens, but Russian Muslims everywhere. Putin persecutes them and ...</p><h2>Lord Darcy Investgates</h2><p>&#34;God may save the king, but Lord Darcy serves him---and serves him well.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Boggart</h2><p>In a tumbledown castle in the Western Highlands of Scotland lives the Boggart. He is invisible -- an ancient mischievous spirit, solitary and sly, born of a magic as old as the rocks and the waves. He has lived in Castle Keep for centuries, playing tricks on the owners. But the last Scottish owner has died and left the castle to his great-nephew Robert Volnik of Toronto, Canada. The Volnik family -- including Emily and her nine-year-old computer genius brother Jessup -- visit Castle Keep, and when they return to Toronto, they unwittingly take the Boggart with them. <br> The astonishments, delight, and horrors that invade their lives with the arrival of the Boggart fill this swiftly moving story. The collision of modern techology and the Old Magic brings perils nobody could have imagined -- and, in the end, an amazing and touching solution to the problem of the Boggart who has found himself on the wrong side of the ocean. <br> Sometimes extremely funny, sometimes wildly scary,and always totally absorbing, this remarkable story -- brilliantly imagined and beautifully written -- marks the return of the Newbery Award winner Susan Cooper to the field of novels for young readers. An outstanding achievement, <i>The Boggart</i> will work its special magic on all who read it.</p><p>When Emily and Jess Volnik's family inherits a remote, crumbling Scottish castle, they also inherit the Boggart -- an invisible, mischievious spirit who's been playing tricks on residents of Castle Keep for generations. Then the Boggart is trapped in a rolltop desk and inadvertently shipped to the Volnik's home in Toronto, where nothing will ever be the same -- for the Volniks or the Boggart. <p>In a world that doesn't believe in magic, the Boggart's pranks wreak havoc, particularly for Emily, who is accused of causing psychic disturbances. And even the newfound joys of peanut butter and pizza and fudge sauce eventually wear thin for the Boggart. He wants to go home -- but his only hope lies in a risky and daring blend of modern technology and ancient magic.</p>Susan Cooper is one of our foremost children&#x2019;s authors; her classic five-book fantasy sequence The Dark Is Rising has sold millions of copies worldwide.

The Art of Stephen Tashjian</i> is the first monograph on the legendary underground painter, puppeteer, performer and--alongside Mark Morrisroe, Nan Goldin and Jack Pierson--member of the so-called Boston School. Tabboo!&#x2019;s paintings, collages and photographs spill over with a riotous mixture of punk energy and high camp; in a 1995 interview with Linda Simpson about his early work, he observed: &#x201c;the subject matter was drag, glamour, ladies&#x2019; shoes, lingerie, hairdos, vinyl--same as now.&#x201d; Tabboo! laces these exuberant themes with defiant resolve, from poignant tributes to friends lost to AIDS, to fairy tales fashioned into sophisticated treatises on gentrification. Chronicling the young artist&#x2019;s arrival in the apocalyptic East Village of the 1980s, <i>Tabboo! The Art of Stephen Tashjian</i> also presents a vast archive of flyers, snapshots and other ephemera that charts the development of the drag performance scene from the Pyramid Club to Wigstock, highlighting its intersection with popular culture and the 1980s art world. Tabboo!&#x2019;s own writings, along with essays by Jack Pierson, Elisabeth Kley and Lia Gangitano (the book&#x2019;s editor), detail his life&#x2019;s work and his collaborations with Mark Morrisroe, Pat Hearn, Howard Stern, Nan Goldin and Deee-Lite, among others. Tabboo!&#x2019;s distinctive style had a profound impact on leading cultural figures of his generation, including Goldin, Morrisroe, Jack Pierson, Steven Meisel, Steven Klein, David Armstrong and Philip-Lorca diCorcia, whose portraits of Tabboo! are also included in the publication.</p><p>Known to most by his drag name, Tabboo!, East Village artist Stephen Tashjian has been a muse, writer, performer, puppeteer, and underground inspiration to many (RuPaul included). This year's book, Tabboo! The Art of Stephen Tashjian - a combination of his visual art and writings, 1980s photographs, and other ephemera - does its best to capture his ebullient persona, though summing up a man who can say, " I met Andy Warhol and he took my picture and he paid for my tickets to go see Liberace ar Radio City Music Hall" is no easy task. (<i>OUT Magazine</i>)<br><br>Artist Stephen Tashjian -- best known by his drag stage name Tabboo! -- has been subverting the norms of good taste for so long now, it seems almost impossible to describe him to the uninitiated. Thankfully, Tashjian's work, a secret treasure from the golden age of '80s New York subculture, will be available to generations of new, young admirers via the book Tabboo! The Art of Stephen Tashjian, a flamboyant account of his life and art.... the book reflects an untold creative wealth. Tabboo! is a poignant autobiography chronicling the evolution of a soul that would never grow up, as well as a peculiar portrait of beauty from a figure who has been muse to many, including Steven Klein, Nan Goldin, Ai Weiwei and Jack Pierson (who wrote an essay for the book). But most of all, the book is a remarkable collection of paintings from an artist whose visionary brut stands as some of the finest work produced in the East Village of yore.

Most considerations of human intelligence are based on the notion that intelligence is a product of brain functioning. A. H. Almaas introduces here a radically different viewpoint, one that recognizes an actual quality of consciousness as the source of intelligence. He calls this source the Brilliancy of our true nature. <br><br>The presentation of his understanding of intelligence is followed by in-depth dialogues with his students on the various barriers to recognizing and embodying this essential quality. In particular, an unresolved relationship with one's father is found to shape the experience of Brilliancy. Using a Socratic method that draws upon techniques of body-centered, Gestalt, psychodynamic, and cognitive psychologies, Almaas helps participants work through their defenses and conflicts surrounding this issue and then, diverging from pychotherapeutic practice, guides them in discovering their own Brilliancy.</p><p>A. H. Almaas is the pen name of Hameed Ali, the Kuwaiti-born originator of the Diamond Approach, who has been guiding individuals and groups in Colorado, California, and Europe since 1976. He is the author of <i>Spacecrusier Inquiry</i>, <i>The Pearl Beyond Price</i>, <i>Facets of Unity</i>, and other books.&nbsp;<i> </i>"In this potent and luminous work, the master teacher A. H. Almaas brings clarity concerning the spiritual ground of Intelligence, which evokes and quickens the reader into a remembrance of her true nature. The presence of the teacher is evident in actual facilitation with his students as well as in words that themselves are transparent to transcendence."&#x2014;Jean Houston, Ph.D., author of <i>Jump Time</i> <br><br>"A. H. Almaas is one of the foremost spiritual teachers of our time. His methodology for realizing true nature is precise, teachable, and remarkably clear."&#x2014;Joan Borysenko, Ph.D., author of <i>Minding the Body, Mending the Mind</i></p><h2>Octopus and Squid: The Soft Intelligence</h2><p>The dazzling flow of life beneath the sea fills these pages with facts as intriguing as any fiction, as famed explorer Jacque-Yves Cousteau (1910-1997) recounts his expeditions across the waterways of the world in search of the elusive truths about the escape artists of the deep. Captain Cousteau&#39;s acquaintance with octopus and squid extends over decades, and his experience taught him that, far from the nightmarish monster of legend, these fascinating creatures are shy, playful, and highly intelligent - and if anything, a friend to man. In an absorbing narrative and 124 full-color photographs, he describes encounters with the &#34;soft intelligence&#34; in a bay off a small island with an octopus under every rock, on an archaeological dig in the Mediterranean where whole colonies turned up ensconced in ancient Greek amphorae, and off the coast of Seattle where giants reaching thirty feet in length dwell. Cousteau also has much to report on his experiences with squid, most memorably a ight in the Pacific when he and his team found their ship Calypso in the middle of a great mating ritual of thousands of the swarming organisms. In addition there are chapters on the sensory apparatus of octopus and squid and their extraordinary arts of camouflage, as well as on those strange cousins of the family, the nautilus and the argonauts. Philippe Victor Diol� (1908 - 1977) was a French author and undersea explorer. With Jacques-Yves Cousteau he co-authored 7 of the 8-volume series The Undersea Discoveries of Jacques-Yves Cousteau (1970-1975) and co-authored The Whale (1987), which was released posthumously.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Week-End Wodehouse</h2><p>This is a collection from P.G. Wodehouse including Drones Club tales, Mr. Mulliner stories, and stories of Jeeves, Lord Emsworth, and Ukridge. The selection also features extracts from Wodehouse&#39;s novels and non-fiction writings.</p><p>P.G. Wodehouse was born in Guildford, Surrey, in 1881 and educated at Dulwich College. After working for the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank for two years, he left to earn his living as a journalist and story-writer. He wrote over ninety books and his work has won worldwide acclaim. He was hailed by The Times as &#39;a comic genius recognised in his lifetime as a classic and an old master of farce.&#39; P.G. Wodehouse said- &#39;I believe there are two ways of writing novels. One is mine, making a sort of musical comedy without music and ignoring real life altogether; the other is going right deep down into life and not caring a damn.&#39; n 1975 he was created a Knight of the British Empire and he died on Valentine&#39;s Day in the same year at the age of ninety-three.</p><h2>Victorian Painting</h2><p>This is a comprehensive survey of one of the most fertile and varied eras in the history of painting. It embraces not just the United Kingdom but also the British-speaking countries linked to Britain by cultural ties of empire and emigration, such as the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Africa. Long regarded as a backwater of sentiment and outmoded academic convention that was bypassed by the mainstream of development in Western art, Victorian painting is now enjoyed in its own right. Unfettered by old prejudices, Lionel Lambourne presents a vivid panorama of an age of unparalleled energy and creativity. Wealth, optimism, education and self-confidence created a huge demand for art and a remarkable array of talent emerged to meet it. Producing works in a wide variety of styles, subjects and media, many artists became rich celebrities, while the profession as a whole enjoyed unprecedented public esteem. The author tackles this protean subject by dividing it into themes which reflect its richness and variety. Chapters are devoted to such topics as mural/history painting, the nude, the portrait, sporting painting, genre scenes and women painters; to social themes such as the fallen woman, social realism, travel and emigration; to movements such as the Pre-Raphaelites. Written with a light touch, full of anecdotes, and with 600 colour illustrations, this study should be entertaining and informative. It should also be a valuable reference work, for in addition to many famous and well-loved images, it presents work by lesser-known artists and explores the byways as well as highways of Victorian art, demonstrating the sheer range and depth of talent that that age produced.</p><p>After 500 pages of sparkling, appreciative text and gorgeously reproduced paintings of fairies, angels, knights in shining armor, Queen Victoria, rustic bumpkins, mermaids, society ladies, gamboling colts, roses, storm-tossed seas, and small children accompanied by mutts, not to mention Ophelia floating beautifully in her watery, flower-strewn grave, readers may feel as if they inhabit the 19th century. It's a shock to wake up to the end of the 20th instead, and to the end of a deeply satisfying book. Lionel Lambourne, who was head of paintings at London's Victoria and Albert Museum for nearly a decade, writes with knowledge, wit, and grace. "Scratch a cynic and you will always find a sentimentalist," he says with regard to Victorian genre painting. In discussing the nude and a return to classicism, he writes, "Such works ... provided an additional thrill for their <i>nouveau riche</i> owners, for by displaying them they could show evidence of classical leanings, if not a classical education."<p> After an excellent introductory overview, Lambourne divides his course into 21 chapters, including: "The Victorian Art Establishment," "The Fresco Revival," "The Panorama," "Childhood and Sentiment," "Fairy Painting," "Sporting and Animal Painting," "The Pre-Raphaelites," "The Frailer Sex and Fallen Woman," "Aesthetes and Symbolists," and "Impressionism in Britain." The editing and design of the book are superb, with reproductions exactly matching the text and captions containing all relevant information. Lambourne offers new dimensions even to history we think we know well, such as Whistler's lawsuit against the critic John Ruskin, who famously accused the artist of "flinging a pot of paint in the public's face." In Lambourne's view, the controversy "marked the beginning of aspects of art as various as conceptualism and abstraction," and he goes on to explain why. A tour de force of scholarship served up with style, <i>Victorian Painting</i> does ample justice to a complex, frequently misunderstood era. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>This text presents an overview of one of the most fertile and exuberant periods in the history of art. It embraces not only the UK but also the English-speaking countries linked to England by the cultural ties of empire and emigration. Long out of fashion, Victorian painting is now enjoyed in its own right. This book is divided by themes into 22 chapters, and features anecdotes and colour illustrations from the period. It can also serve as a reference work as it features the work of some lesser-known artists, as well as the famous and well-loved images.</p><h2>The Voice of the Heart, Second Edition + Bible Study by Phil Herndon (2014-05-03)</h2><p>Discover the gift of The Eight FeelingsTM with The Voice of the Heart, Second Edition and the new companion Bible study.

It&#x2019;s a hum,&#x201d; answers Plastic.<br><br> No one says anything for a while, after that.<br><br> &#x201c;Does anyone know where we&#x2019;re going in here?&#x201d; wonders Lumphy.<br><br> Plastic does not.<br><br> StingRay doesn&#x2019;t, either.<br><br> &#x201c;My stomach is uncomfortable,&#x201d; grumphs the buffalo. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m going to be sick.&#x201d;<br><br> . . . . .<br><br> Buh-buh bump! It feels like the backpack is going down some stairs. Or maybe up some stairs.<br><br> Or maybe up something worse than stairs.<br><br> StingRay tries to think calming thoughts. She pictures the high bed with the fluffy pillows where she usually sleeps. She pictures the Little Girl with the blue barrette, who scratches where the ears would be if StingRay had ears. But none of these thoughts makes her feel calm.<br><br> &#x201c;I hope we&#x2019;re not going to the vet,&#x201d; StingRay says, finally.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the vet?&#x201d; asks Lumphy.<br><br> &#x201c;The vet is a big human dressed in a white coat who puts animals in a contraption made from rubber bands, in order to see what is wrong with them,&#x201d; answers StingRay, who sometimes says she knows things when she doesn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;Then he pokes them over and over<br><br> with needles the size of carrots,<br><br> and makes them drink nasty-tasting medicine,<br><br> and puts them in the bumpity washing machine to fix whatever&#x2019;s broken.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;If anyone needs to go to the vet, it&#x2019;s the one-eared sheep,&#x201d; says Plastic, remembering the oldest of the Little Girl&#x2019;s toys. &#x201c;And Sheep&#x2019;s not even here. No, we can&#x2019;t be going to the vet. We aren&#x2019;t broken.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Speak for yourself,&#x201d; snorts Lumphy, who feels even sicker than before at the thought of the bumpity washing machine.<br><br> . . . . .<br><br> Woosh. Woosh. The backpack begins to swing.<br><br> Back and forth. Back and forth.<br><br> Or maybe round and round.<br><br> &#x201c;I hope we&#x2019;re not going to the zoo,&#x201d; moans StingRay.<br><br> &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll put us in cages with no one to talk to. Each one in a separate cage,<br><br> and we&#x2019;ll have to woosh back and forth all day,<br><br> and do tricks on giant swings,<br><br> with people throwing quarters at our faces,<br><br> and teasing.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re big enough for the zoo,&#x201d; Plastic says hopefully. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty sure they&#x2019;re only interested in very large animals over there.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m large,&#x201d; says Lumphy.<br><br> &#x201c;She means really, really, very large,&#x201d; says StingRay. &#x201c;At the zoo they have stingrays the size of choo-choo trains;<br><br> and plastics the size of swimming pools.<br><br> Zoo buffaloes would never fit in a backpack.<br><br> They eat backpacks for lunch, those buffaloes.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Is that true?&#x201d; asks Lumphy, but nobody answers him.<br><br> . . . . .<br><br> Plunk! The backpack is thrown onto the ground.<br><br> Or maybe into a trash can.<br><br> Or onto a garbage truck.<br><br> &#x201c;We might be going to the dump!&#x201d; cries StingRay. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be tossed in a pile of old green beans,<br><br> and sour milk cartons,<br><br> because the Little Girl doesn&#x2019;t love us anymore,<br><br> and it will be icy cold all the time,<br><br> and full of garbage-eating sharks,<br><br> and it will smell like throw-up.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so,&#x201d; soothes Plastic.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be forced to sleep on a slimy bit of used paper baggie, instead of on the big high bed with the fluffy pillows!&#x201d; continues StingRay.<br><br> There is a noise outside the backpack. Not a big noise, but a rumbly one. &#x201c;Did you hear that?&#x201d; asks StingRay. &#x201c;I think it is the X-ray machine. The vet is going to X-ray us one by one<br><br> and look into our insides with an enormous magnifying glass,<br><br> and then poke us with the giant carrot!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s not an X-ray,&#x201d; says Plastic calmly, although she isn&#x2019;t sure at all. &#x201c;An X-ray would be squeakier.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then I think it is a lion,&#x201d; cries StingRay. &#x201c;A lion at the zoo who does not want to be on display with any small creatures like you and me.<br><br> A lion who doesn&#x2019;t like sharing her swing set,<br><br> and wants all the quarters for herself.<br><br> She is roaring because she hasn&#x2019;t had any lunch yet,<br><br> and her favorite food is stingrays.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;A lion would be fiercer,&#x201d; says Plastic, a bit un- certainly. &#x201c;It would sound hungrier, I bet.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe it is a giant buffalo,&#x201d; suggests Lumphy.<br><br> &#x201c;Maybe it is a dump truck!&#x201d; squeals StingRay. &#x201c;A big orange dump truck tipping out piles of rotten groceries on top of us,<br><br> and trapping us with the garbage-eating sharks<br><br> and the throw-up smell!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t a dump truck be louder?&#x201d; asks Plastic, though she is starting to think StingRay might have a point. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s not a dump truck.&#x201d;<br><br> . . . . .<br><br> The backpack thumps down again with a bang. &#x201c;I would like to be warned,&#x201d; moans Lumphy. &#x201c;Sudden bumps make everything worse than it already is.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The Girl doesn&#x2019;t love us and she&#x2019;s trying to get rid of us!&#x201d; cries StingRay in a panic.<br><br> The backpack opens. The rumbly noise gets louder, and the light is very bright&#x2014;so bright that StingRay, Plastic, and Lumphy have to squinch up their eyes and take deep breaths before they can see where they are. A pair of warm arms takes them all out of the dark, wet-bathing-suit smell together.<br><br> The three toys look around. There are small chairs, a sunny window, and a circle of fidgety faces.<br><br> It is not the vet.<br><br> It is not the zoo.<br><br> It is not the dump. (They are pretty sure.)<br><br> But where is it?<br><br> The rumbly noise surges up. A grown-up asks everyone to Please Be Quiet Now. And then comes a familiar voice.<br><br> &#x201c;These are my best friends,&#x201d; says the Little Girl who owns the backpack and sleeps in the high bed with the fluffy pillows. &#x201c;My best friends in the world. That&#x2019;s why I brought them to show-and-tell.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Welcome,&#x201d; says the teacher.<br><br> Sticky, unfamiliar fingers pat Lumphy&#x2019;s head and StingRay&#x2019;s plush tail.<br><br> Plastic is held up for all to admire. &#x201c;We are here to be shown and told,&#x201d; she whispers to StingRay and Lumphy, feeling quite bouncy as she looks around at the schoolroom. &#x201c;Not to be thrown away or put under the X-ray machine!&#x201d;<br><br> The teacher says Lumphy looks a lot like a real buffalo. (Lumphy wonders what the teacher means by &#x201c;real,&#x201d; but he is too happy to worry much about it.)<br><br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;re special!&#x201d; whispers StingRay. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re her best friends!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I knew it would be something nice,&#x201d; says Plastic.<br><br> . . . . .<br><br> Funny, but the ride home is not so uncomfortable. The smell is still there, but the backpack seems rather cozy. Plastic has herself a nap.<br><br> StingRay isn&#x2019; t worried about vets and zoos and gar-bage dumps anymore; she curls herself into a ball by Lumphy&#x2019;s buffalo stomach. &#x201c;The Little Girl loves us,&#x201d; she tells him. &#x201c;I knew it all along, really. I just didn&#x2019;t want to say.&#x201d;<br><br> Lumphy licks StingRay&#x2019; s head once, and settles down to wait. When he knows where he is going, traveling isn&#x2019;t so bad.

Animation Art</h2><p>Warner Bros has opened up its archives for official researchers to trace the history of its most famous characters, including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Taz, Sylvester, Tweety Pie, Porky Pig and Yosemite Sam, as well as detailing more contemporary creations such as the animated Batman, Tiny Toons and Animaniacs. This text traces the history of the characters and the men who created them, telling the story of Warner Bros, how the animation unit was established and how it grew. The book also presents photographs of the animators and technicians at work in the studio as well as reproductions of original animation cells and the limited edition prints.</p><p>"Before 1977, relatively few people were aware of animation cels as an art form," Beck and Friedwald inaugurally opine. Discussion of collectible cel art soon slips away, though, as the object becomes not to evaluate Warner animation, but to praise it on big, lavishly illustrated pages that are bound for heavy duty. Exhaustiveness is not a concern: Beck and Friedwald spotlight a lesser character like Michigan J. Frog, but not many others, mostly, it seems, because M. J. is the spokes-'toon for Warner's TV network. Still, there is plenty of tribute to major creative stalwarts like voice man Mel Blanc and directors Bob Clampett, Friz Freleng, Bob McKimson, Tex Avery, and Chuck Jones. The upbeat exposition even cites a few controversies, such as the trimming of <i>Heckling Hare</i> that contributed to Avery's leaving Warner (what the original ending was or why it was changed are never specified, though). Mickey Mouse may be a more successful corporate shill, but Bugs Bunny is the quintessential funny animal. Celebrate him and his posse with this grand tribute. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>Alphabet</h2><p>Inger Christensen (1935-2009) was both a virtuoso and a paradox. Her fiction, drama, essays and children s books won her wide acclaim in Denmark and other European countries, but it is her poetry - spanning a forty-year period - that best reveals her versatility and depth. Her poetry reflects a complex philosophical background, yet her most complex poetic works have enjoyed wide public popularity. Many of her poems have a visionary quality, yet she is a paradoxically down-to-earth visionary, focusing on the simple stuff of everyday life and in it discovering the metaphysical as if by chance. In alphabet, Christensen creates a framework of psalm-like forms that unfold like expanding universes, crystallising into words both the beauty and the potential for destruction that permeate our world and our times.</p><p>Inger Christensen (1935&#x2013; 2009), whose work is a cornerstone of modern Scandinavian poetry, was the recipient of many international awards, among them the Nordic Authors&#x2019; Prize, bestowed by the Swedish Academy and known as the &#x201c;Little Nobel.&#x201d; Her books include the masterpiece it; alphabet; Butterfly Valley; and Light, Grass, and Letter in April.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Danish</p><h2>Addy&#39;s Surprise: A Christmas Story (American Girl Collection)</h2><p>Knowing that Christmas will be hard without the rest of her family, Addy sets out to earn money to give her mother a special Christmas gift, but after discovering the plight of newly freed slaves, she decides to give her money to the Freedman&#39;s Fund.</p><p></p><h2>Old Testament Who&#39;s Who</h2><p>Enhance your gospel study with this incredible new resource that provides an encyclopedia-like portrayal of the hundreds of people discussed in the gospel doctrine course of study for the Old Testament.

Hutton preserves a sense of Homeric scale and complexity both in text and in pictures. The forgotten lovers who started it all are poignantly evoked at the end; the frivolity of the huge, toylike horse, with its faint archaic smile is contrasted with the utter ruin of the city, graphically suggested in a masterly double-page spread of the massive, breached walls, fire within, a thick column of smoke and a thin column of exiles stretching into the distance. Hutton sacrifices some of his usual tender blues and lush greens for the pale yellow, umber, and lavender of the Anatolian plain. Some may find the horse insufficiently noble, but its meaning echoes in the repeated motif of a child's wheeled wooden toy, last seen overturned and abandoned in the rout. The Trojan War is introduced as being neither heroic nor despicable, but as an epic memory brought vividly and unforgettably to life. --Patricia Dooley, University of Washington, Seattle<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Again, Hutton's verbal and visual simplicity will evoke complex responses. In a brief retelling of Troy's fall, he offers a subtle comment on the whole subject of war: Paris, fleeing with Helen (they look more like dancers than fugitives), looks out at the reader with a knowing Archaic smile that reappears on the faces of the serpents as they crush the life out of Laoco&#x201d;n and his sons, and again on the huge, round-bellied horse. Some of the Trojans' clothing has a modern look, and the text closes on an ironic note--the horse towers over the ruined city, but ``Everyone had forgotten Paris and Helen, who had started it all.'' Occasionally, the spareness of the illustrations backfires--in one scene the Trojans are pulling the horse toward a gate that looks small rather than distant--but the focus of the action is always plain, even when the human figures are dwarfed by the city walls. A thoughtful, multilayered introduction to this ancient tale. (Picture book. 6-9) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Claire Douglas brings the early days of analytical psychology alive as she traces Morgan's turbulent life: her girlhood in a prominent Boston family; her society debut and early loves; her escape into nursing in World War I; her difficult marriage; her intellectual awakening in the ferment of postwar New York; her impassioned analysis with Jung; her love affairs and friendships with Chaim Weizmann, Henry A. Murray, Alfred North Whitehead, Lewis Mumford and others; her role as an analyst and a contributor to psychological thought at the Harvard Psychological Clinic; her visionary quest with Jung and later at her Romantic tower retreat; her tragic death.<br>Based on access to Morgan's papers and thirteen years' research, the book includes some of Morgan's own illustrations of her harrowing visions. At once compelling in human terms and riveting from a feminist point of view, this authoritative portrait of a woman's struggles in a man's domain explores a vital question: how well has the world of psychology listened to the female soul?</p><p><p>"Douglas's book is important in showing the kind of person who was drawn to this psychology and how it did and did not help such seekers in the furthering of their lives.

Virginia Lee Williams is an award-winning collage artist who teaches watercolor workshops in watermedia collage.Collage is a versatile and dynamic medium suitable for artists with any level of skill and experience. Collage can be spontaneous and inexpensive when artists use materials at hand, such as magazines or newspapers, or collage can involve elaborate designs, precise detail, and exquisite craftsmanship. Materials suitable for collage are limited only by the creator's imagination and include papers of all kinds, fabric, photographs, and three-dimensional objects. Media such as watercolor, ink, and acrylics can be used to create varied effects and textures. Instructor, artist, and author Leland and her collage-artist coauthor Williams provide readers with step-by-step instructions for increasingly sophisticated collage techniques. Charts highlight recommended materials such as adhesives, protective coatings, types of paper, and supports. Numerous examples of finished collages are displayed in color reproductions, from homey family projects to beautifully textured abstractions. While Leland and Williams excel at covering technique and practical concerns, they spend some time discussing design principles and the matching of materials to subject or theme. This is as comprehensive and useful as a how-to on collage can be. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People (Revised)</h2><p>Dale Carnegie's enduring classic, the inspirational personal development guide that shows how to achieve lifelong success. One of the top-selling books of all time, "How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People" has sold more than 15 million copies in all its editions.</p><p>This grandfather of all people-skills books was first published in 1937. It was an overnight hit, eventually selling 15 million copies. <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> is just as useful today as it was when it was first published, because Dale Carnegie had an understanding of human nature that will never be outdated. Financial success, Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to "the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people." He teaches these skills through underlying principles of dealing with people so that they feel important and appreciated. He also emphasizes fundamental techniques for handling people without making them feel manipulated. Carnegie says you can make someone want to do what you want them to by seeing the situation from the other person's point of view and "arousing in the other person an eager want." You learn how to make people like you, win people over to your way of thinking, and change people without causing offense or arousing resentment. For instance, "let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers," and "talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person." Carnegie illustrates his points with anecdotes of historical figures, leaders of the business world, and everyday folks. <i>--Joan Price</i>Dale Carnegie (1888-1955) described himself as a &#34;simple country boy&#34; from Missouri but was also a pioneer of the self-improvement genre.

He is the author of many books, among them the bestselling<i>Jewish Literacy</i> and <i>The Nine Questions People Ask About Judaism.</i> Rabbi Telushkin lectures widely throughout North America and serves as rabbi for the Synagogue for the Performing Arts in Los Angeles. He lives in New York City.Rabbi Telushkin (An Eye for an Eye, 1991), rooted in the tradition of reverence for past learning, has gathered lots of hoary jokes and aged wisecracks, together with a few more recent japes, that make Jews laugh. To coreligionists, they'll seem like old friends; to others, the gags and their elucidation may be more in the nature of revelation. Another book of ethnic gags? Hold the cry of ``gevalt!'' because Telushkin has an unstated agenda. True to his calling, he uses the funny stuff to instruct. In this collection (in which some bits are, naturally, funnier than others), everything stands for something else--but all of it carries explanations. The exegesis of the jokes becomes a little primer on a religion and a way of life mystifying to strangers and sometimes just as puzzling to nominal adherents. It's a truism that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle applies to humor--observing and analyzing it alters it. That effect can be seen here as Telushkin trots out Jackie Mason and Sigmund Freud, as well as Leo Rosten and a host of Unknown Comics for a higher purpose. The tales of the wise rabbis, the fabled fools of Chelm, the anti-Semites, the schnorrers, and the big shots all serve to illustrate his lessons. Was the shtetl a forerunner of Catskills on Broadway? Why are comedians so often Jewish? Why are Jews so often comedians? Why ask questions? Just listen to the rabbi and his jokes. Fine, funny fare for Jew and non-Jew alike. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Generously illustrated with archival prints and photos and Catlin&#x2019;s own magnificent paintings, here is a rollicking, accessible biography that weaves meticulously researched history into a fascinating frontier and jungle adventure story.<br></p><p>Susanna Reich is the author of Clara Schumann: Piano Virtuoso, which was named an ALA Notable Children&#x2019;s Book, a YALSA Best Book for Young Adults, a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year, and a Notable Social Studies Trade Book for Young People.

It was all Prissy's damn fault that Marty was in such a hurry to get to the Blue-Ribbon Jalape�o Society monthly meeting that night, so Prissy ought to have to shell out the almost two hundred dollars for that ticket.</p> <p>They were already passing around the crystal bowl to take up the voting ballots when Marty slung open the door to Violet Prescott's sunroom and yelled, "Don't count 'em without my vote."</p> <p>Twenty faces turned to look at her and not a one of them, not even her twin sister, Cathy, was smiling. Hell's bells, who had done pissed on their cucumber sandwiches before she got there, anyway? A person didn't drop dead from lack of punctuality, did they?</p> <p>One wall of the sunroom was glass and looked out over lush green lawns and flower gardens. The other three were covered with shadow boxes housing the blue ribbons that the members had won at the Texas State Fair for their jalape�o pepper entries. More than forty shadow boxes all reminding the members of their history and their responsibility for the upcoming year. Bless Cathy's heart for doing her part. She had a little garden of jalape�os on the east side of the lawn and nurtured them like children. The newest shadow box held ribbons that she'd earned for the club with her pepper jelly and picante. It was the soil, or maybe she told them bedtime stories, but she, like her mamma and grandma, grew the hottest jalape�os in the state.</p> <p>"It appears that Martha has decided to grace us with her presence once again when it is time to vote for someone to take our dear Prissy's place in the Blue-Ribbon Jalape�o Society. We really should amend our charter to state that a member has to attend more than one meeting every two years. You could appreciate the fact that we did amend it once to include you in the membership with your sister, who, by the way, has a spotless attendance record," Violet said.</p> <p>Violet, the queen of the club, as most of the members called it, was up near eighty years old, built like SpongeBob SquarePants, and had stovepipe jet-black hair right out of the bottle. Few people had the balls or the nerve to cross her, and those who did were put on her shit list right under Martha, aka Marty, Andrews' name, which was always on the top.</p> <p>Back in the beginning of the club days, before Marty was even born, the mayor's wife held the top position on the shit list. When they'd formed the Blue-Ribbon Jalape�o Society, Loretta Massey and Violet almost went to war over the name of the new club. Loretta insisted that it be called a society, and Violet wanted it to be called a club. Belonging to a club just sounded so much fancier than saying that one belonged to a society. Loretta won when the vote came in, but Violet called it a club anyway and that's what stuck. Rumor had it that Violet was instrumental in getting the mayor ousted just so they'd have to leave Grayson County and Loretta would have to quit the club.</p> <p>Marty hated it when people called her Martha. It sounded like an old woman's name. What was her mother thinking anyway when she looked down at two little identical twin baby daughters and named them after her mother and aunt-Martha and Catherine? Thank God she'd at least shortened their names to Marty and Cathy.</p> <p>Marty shrugged, and Violet snorted. Granted, it was a ladylike snort, but it still went right along with her round face and three-layered neck. Hell, if they wanted to write forty amendments to the charter, Marty would still do only the bare necessities to keep her in voting standing. She hadn't even wanted to be in the damned club and had only done it because if she didn't, then Cathy couldn't.</p> <p>Marty slid into a seat beside her sister and held up her ballot.</p> <p>Beulah had the bowl in hand and was ready to hand it off to Violet to read off the votes. But she passed it to the lady on the other side of her and it went back around the circle to Marty, who tossed in her folded piece of paper. If she'd done her homework and gotten the numbers right, that one vote should swing the favor for Anna Ruth to be the new member of the club. She didn't like Anna Ruth, especially since she'd broken up her best friend's marriage. But hey, Marty had made a deathbed promise to her mamma, and that carried more weight than the name of a hussy on a piece of paper.</p> <p>The bowl went back to Violet and she put it in her lap like the coveted jeweled crown of a reigning queen. "Our amended charter states that only twenty-one women can belong to the Blue-Ribbon Jalape�o Society at any one time, and the only time we vote a new member in is when someone moves or dies. Since Prissy Parnell got married this past week and moved away from Grayson County, we are open for one new member. The four names on the ballet are: Agnes Flynn, Trixie Matthews, Anna Ruth Williams, and Gloria Rawlings."</p> <p>Even though it wasn't in the fine print, everyone knew that when attending a meeting, the members should dress for the occasion, which meant panty hose and heels. Marty could feel nineteen pairs of eyes on her. It would have been twenty, but Violet was busy fishing the first ballot from the fancy bowl.</p> <p>Marty threw one long leg over the other and let the bright red three-inch high-heeled shoe dangle on her toe. They could frown all they wanted. She was wearing a dress, even if it only reached mid-thigh, and had black spandex leggings under it. If they wanted her to wear panty hose, they'd better put a second amendment on that charter and make it in big print.</p> <p>God Almighty, but she'd be glad when her great-aunt died and she could quit the club. But it looked like Agnes was going to last forever, which was no surprise. God sure didn't want her in heaven, and the devil wouldn't have her in hell.</p> <p>"One vote for Agnes," Violet said aloud.</p> <p>Beulah marked that down on the minutes and waited.</p> <p>Violet enjoyed her role as president of the club and took her own sweet time with each ballot. Too bad she hadn't dropped dead or at least moved to California so Cathy could be president. Marty would bet her sister would get those votes counted a hell of a lot faster.</p> <p>There was one piece of paper in the candy dish when Beulah held up a hand. "We've got six each for Agnes, Trixie, Anna Ruth, and two for Gloria. Unless this last vote is for Agnes, Trixie, or Anna Ruth, we have a tie, and we'll have to have a run-off election."</p> <p>"Shit!" Marty mumbled.</p> <p>Cathy shot her a dirty look.</p> <p>"Anna Ruth," Violet said and let out a whoosh of air.</p> <p>A smile tickled the corner of Marty's mouth.</p> <p>Saved, by damn!</p> <p>Agnes was saved from prison.</p> <p>Violet was saved from attending her own funeral.</p> <p>The speeding ticket was worth every penny.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Trixie poked the black button beside the nursing home door and kicked yellow and orange leaves away as she reached for the handle. She heard the familiar click as the lock let go and then heard someone yell her name.</p> <p>"Hey, Trixie. Don't shut it. We are here," Cathy called out.</p> <p>Trixie waved at her two best friends: Cathy and Marty Andrews. Attitude and hair color kept them from being identical. They were five feet ten inches tall and slim built, but Cathy kept blond highlights in her brown hair and Marty's was natural. In attitude, they were as different as vanilla and chocolate. Cathy was the sweet twin who loved everyone and had trouble speaking her mind. Marty was the extrovert who called the shots like she saw them. Cathy was engaged, and Marty said there were too many cowboys she hadn't taken to bed to get herself tied down to one man.</p> <p>Marty threw an arm around Trixie's shoulder as they marched down the wide hall. Trixie's mother, Janie Matthews, had checked herself into the nursing home four years before when her Alzheimer's had gotten so bad that she didn't know Trixie one day. Trixie had tried to talk her mother into living with her, but Janie was lucid enough to declare that she couldn't live alone and her daughter had to work.</p> <p>"Congratulations, darlin', you did not make it into the club tonight. Your life has been spared until someone dies or moves away and Cathy nominates you again," Marty said.</p> <p>"Well, praise the Lord," Trixie said.</p> <p>"I know. Let's string Cathy up by her toenails and force-feed her fried potatoes until her wedding dress won't fit for even putting your name in the pot." Marty laughed.</p> <p>"Trixie would be a wonderful addition to the club. She wouldn't let Violet run her around like a windup toy. That's why I keep nominating her every chance I get," Cathy said. "Anna Ruth is going to be a brand new puppet in Violet's hands. Every bit as bad as Gloria would have been."</p> <p>Trixie stopped so fast that Marty's hand slipped off her shoulder. "Anna Ruth?"</p> <p>"Sorry." Cathy shrugged. "I'm surprised that she won and she only did by one vote."</p> <p>Trixie did a head wiggle. "Don't the world turn around? My mamma wasn't fit for the club because she had me out of wedlock. And now Anna Ruth is living with my husband without a marriage certificate and she gets inducted. If she has a baby before they marry, do they have a big divorce ceremony and kick her out?"</p> <p>"I never thought she'd get it," Cathy said. "I don't know how in the world I'm going to put up with her in club, knowing that she's the one that broke up your marriage."</p> <p>Trixie paled. "Who's going to tell Agnes that she didn't get it again? Lord, she's going to be an old bear all week."</p> <p>"That's Beulah's job. She nominated her. I'm just damn glad I have a class tonight. Maybe the storm will be over before I get home," Marty said.</p> <p>Cathy smiled weakly. "And I've got dinner with Ethan back at Violet's in an hour."</p> <p>"I'm not even turning on the lights when I get home. Maybe she'll think I've died." Trixie started walking again.</p> <p>"You okay with the Anna Ruth thing?" Marty asked.</p> <p>Trixie nodded. "Can't think of a better thing to happen to y'all's club."</p> <p>"It's not my club," Marty said. "I'm just there so Cathy can be in it. I'm not sure Violet would let her precious son marry a woman who wasn't in the al-damn-mighty Blue-Ribbon Jalape�o Society. I still can't believe that Violet is okay with her precious son marrying one of the Andrews' twins."</p> <p>Cathy pointed a long slender finger at her sister. "Don't you start with me! And I'm not the feisty twin. You are. I can't see Violet letting Ethan marry you for sure."</p> <p>"Touchy, are we? Well, darlin' sister, I wouldn't have that man, mostly because I'd have to put up with Violet." Marty giggled.</p> <p>"Shhh, no fighting. It'll upset Mamma." Trixie rapped gently on the frame of the open door and poked her head inside a room. "Anyone at home?"</p> <p>Janie Matthews clapped her hands and her eyes lit up. She and Trixie were mirror images of each other-short, slim built, light brown hair, milk chocolate-colored eyes, and delicate features. Trixie wore her hair in a chin-length bob, and Janie's was long, braided, and wrapped around her head in a crown. Other than that and a few wrinkles around Janie's eyes, they looked more like sisters than mother and daughter.</p> <p>"Why, Clawdy Burton, you've come to visit. Sit down, darlin', and let's talk. You aren't still mad at me, are you?"</p> <p>Marty crossed the room and sat down beside Janie on the bed, leaving the two chairs in the room for Cathy and Trixie. It wasn't the first time Janie had mistaken her for Claudia, the twins' mother, or the first time that she'd remembered Claudia by her maiden name, either.</p> <p>"I brought some friends," Marty said.</p> <p>"Any friend of Clawdy's is a friend of mine. Come right in here. You look familiar. Did you go to school with me and Clawdy?" Janie looked right at her daughter.</p> <p>"I did," Trixie said.</p> <p>Janie's brow furrowed. "I can't put a name with your face."</p> <p>"I'm Trixie."</p> <p>Janie shook her head. "Sorry, honey, I don't remember you. And you?" She looked into Cathy's eyes.</p> <p>"She's my sister, Cathy, remember?" Marty asked.</p> <p>"Well, ain't that funny. I never knew Clawdy to have a sister. You must be older than we are, but I can see the resemblance."</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am, I didn't know you as well as"-Cathy paused-"my little sister did, but I remember coming to your house."</p> <p>"Did Mamma make fried chicken for you?"</p> <p>"Oh, honey, I've eaten fried chicken more than once at your house," Cathy said.</p> <p>"Good. Mamma makes the best fried chicken in the whole world. She and Clawdy's mamma know how to do it just right. Now, Clawdy, tell me you aren't mad at me. I made a mistake runnin' off with Rusty like that, but we can be friends now, can't we?"</p> <p>Marty patted her on the arm. "You know I could never stay mad at you."</p> <p>"I'm just so glad you got my letter and came to visit." Janie looked at Trixie and drew her eyes down. "You look just like a girl I used to know. It's right there on the edge of my mind, but I've got this remembering disease. That's why I'm in here, so they can help me." She turned her attention back to Marty. "You really aren't mad at me anymore?"</p> <p>"Of course not. You were in love with Rusty or you wouldn't have run off with him," Marty said. They had this conversation often so she knew exactly what to say.</p> <p>"I did love him, but he found someone new, so I had to bring my baby girl and come on back home. How are your girls?" She jumped at least five years from thinking she and Claudia were in school to the time when they were new mothers.</p> <p>"They're fine. Let's talk about you," Marty said.</p> <p>Janie yawned. "Clawdy, darlin', I'm so sorry, but I can't keep my eyes open anymore."</p> <p>It was always the same. On Wednesday nights, Trixie visited with Janie. Sometimes, when they had time between closing the caf� and their other Wednesday evening plans, Marty and Cathy went with her. And always after fifteen or twenty minutes, on a good night, she was sleepy.</p> <p>"That's okay, Janie. We'll come see you again soon," Marty said.</p> <p>Trixie stopped at the doorway and waved.</p> <p>Janie frowned. "I'm sorry I can't remember you. You remind me of someone I knew a long time ago, but I can't recall your name. Were you the Jalape�o Jubilee queen this year? Maybe that's where I saw you."</p> <p>"No, ma'am. They don't crown queens anymore. But it's okay. I remember you real well," Trixie said.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Less than half an hour later, Trixie parked beside a big two-story house sitting on the corner of Main and Fourth in Cadillac, Texas. The sign outside the house said Miss Clawdy's Caf� in fancy lettering. Above it were the words: Red Beans and Turnip Greens.</p> <p>Most folks in town just called it Clawdy's.</p> <p>It had started as a joke after Cathy and Marty's mamma, Claudia, died and the three of them were going through her recipes. They'd actually been searching for "the secret," but evidently Claudia took it to the grave with her.</p> <p>More than forty years ago, Grayson County and Fannin County women were having a heated argument over who could grow the hottest jalape�os in North Texas. Idalou Thomas, over in Fannin County, had won the contest for her jalape�o cornbre...</p></p><h2>The Vault of Walt</h2><p>This best-selling book is now out-of-print.<br><br> But a new edition, with new stories, is available: The REVISED Vault of Walt.</p><p>Jim Korkis is an internationally respected Disney historian who has written hundreds of articles about all things Disney for over three decades. He is also an award winning teacher, professional actor and magician and author of several books about animation. He grew up in Glendale, California, right next to Burbank, the home of the Disney Studios. His third grade teacher at Thomas Edison Elementary School was Mrs. Disney, the wife of one of Walt Disney&#x2019;s brothers. Upon discovering this fact, Jim took a large sheet of easel paper and drew a huge picture of Jiminy Cricket, his favorite Disney character at the time. He gave it to Mrs. Disney in the hopes that she would immediately take it to the Disney Studios where he would be offered a job and not have to learn his multiplication tables. He was not hired and still has trouble with math to this day. As a teenager, Jim wrote down the names he saw on the credits of Disney animated cartoons and went to the Glendale-Burbank phone book and cold called some of them. Many were gracious enough to ask him to visit them with the resulting articles sometimes appearing in the local newspapers or various &#x201c;fan-zines&#x201d; and magazines. Over the decades, Jim pursued a teaching career as well as a performing career but was still active in writing about Disney for various magazines. In 1995, he relocated to Orlando, Florida to take care of his ailing parents. He got a job doing magic and making balloon animals for guests at Pleasure Island. Within a month, he was moved over to the Magic Kingdom, where he &#x201c;assisted in the portrayal of&#x201d; Prospector Pat in Frontierland and Merlin in Fantasyland for the Sword in the Stone ceremony. He has pictures, videos and pay stubs to prove it. In 1996, he became a full time salaried animation instructor at the Disney Institute where he taught every animation class including several that only he taught. He also instructed classes on animation history and improvisational acting techniques for the interns at Disney Feature Animation Florida. As the Disney Institute re-organized, Jim joined Disney Adult Discoveries, the group who researched, wrote and facilitated backstage tours and programs for Disney guests and Disneyana conventions. Eventually, Jim moved to Epcot where he was a Coordinator with College and International Programs and then a Coordinator for the Epcot Disney Learning Center. During his time at Epcot, Jim researched, wrote and facilitated over two hundred different presentations on Disney history for Disney cast members and corporate clients including Feld Entertainment, Kodak, Blue Cross, Toys R Us, Military Sales and more. He was the off camera announcer for the syndicated television series Secrets of the Animal Kingdom, wrote articles for Disney publications like Disney Adventures, Disney Files (DVC), Sketches, Disney Insider and more. He worked on special projects like writing text for WDW trading cards, on camera host for the 100 Years of Magic Vacation Planning video, facilitator with the Disney Crew puppet show and countless other credits including assisting Disney Cruise Line, WDW Travel Company, Imagineering and Disney Design Group with Disney historical material. As a result, Jim was the recipient of the prestigious Disney award, Partners in Excellence, in 2004. Jim is not currently an employee of the Disney Company.</p><h2>Celtic Design: Illuminated Letters</h2><p><p><strong>From the Celtic Design series: a reference manual on Celtic illuminated letters, blending history and anecdote with practical instruction.</strong></p> The step-by-step instructions provide an invaluable resource for artists, designers, and craftspeople&#x2015;a unique blend of history, anecdote, and practical instruction that recreates the schooling of the Celtic illuminator.

In nine original essays by a multinational group of top scholars, <i>Tropical Babylons</i> re-evaluates this so-called "sugar revolution." The most comprehensive comparative study to date of early Atlantic sugar economies, this collection presents a revisionist examination of the origins of society and economy in the Atlantic world.<br><br>Focusing on areas colonized by Spain and Portugal (before the emergence of the Caribbean sugar colonies of England, France, and Holland), these essays show that despite reliance on common knowledge and technology, there were considerable variations in the way sugar was produced. With studies of Iberia, Madeira and the Canary Islands, Hispaniola, Cuba, Brazil, and Barbados, this volume demonstrates the similarities and differences between the plantation colonies, questions the very idea of a sugar revolution, and shows how the specific conditions in each colony influenced the way sugar was produced and the impact of that crop on the formation of "tropical Babylons--multiracial societies of great oppression.<br>Contributors:<br>Alejandro de la Fuente, University of Pittsburgh<br>Herbert Klein, Columbia University<br>John J.

But this year it seems as if everybody in Bear Country has gone Christmas-crazy -- fighting for the last toy on the shelf, jamming the roadways with honking cars, and covering Bear homes with enough Christmas lights to blot out the stars. </p><p>Mama Bear isn't the only one who thinks this Christmas lacks the true holiday spirit. Someone is watching the Bears on his scanner-machine -- someone who knows more about Christmas than anyone and doesn't like what he sees one bit. It is Santa Bear, of course, and he's ready to take drastic action! Only the Berenstain Bears can change his mind, but will they be in time to save Christmas?</p><p>Like the Bear family, Stan, Jan, and Mike Berenstain have the true Christmas spirit in their hearts, and they prove it with this merry holiday story.</p></p><p><p>Stan and Jan Berenstain were already successful cartoonists for magazines and adult humor books when they began writing children's books. The first story starring the bear family, <em>The Big Honey Hunt</em>, appeared in 1962. Since then, more than 250 Berenstain Bears books have been published, and more than 260 million copies have been sold. What began as an idea sparked by their young sons' interest in children's books has become over the years arguably the best-selling children's book series ever. </p><p>Since their inception, the Berenstain Bears stories have expanded to include picture books, beginning readers, and chapter books&#x2014;even a hit TV show on PBS. Writing and illustrating the books has become a Berenstain family affair. Mike joined with his parents as a creative team in the late 1980s. The Bear family has expanded over the years as well. Sister Bear arrived in 1974, and baby Honey joined the family in 2000. </p><p>Since Stan's death at age eighty-two in 2005, Jan and Mike have continued to write and illustrate wonderful new adventures for Mama, Papa, Brother, Sister, and Honey Bear. They live in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which looks a lot like Bear Country. </p>Grade 1-3-From e-mails he receives from cubs, and by observing on his scanner machine, Santa Bear concludes that Christmas has been ruined: families are rude and competitive and the "-Christmas greedies were spreading through the land." He sets out, incognito, to search for the true spirit of the season. Luckily, Mama Bear has already put the brakes on, and the Bear family has reformed when disguised Santa arrives. Once again, a moral imperative is pounded home in the Berenstains' familiar, formulaic way. Problems of the overlong text, the meter that doesn't scan, and the canned illustrations will hardly matter to the Bears' many fans.-S.

Beagle's Preface to this volume, "cries out to be read aloud."</p><p>Avram Davidson was born in Yonkers, New York, in 1923. After spending some time at New York University, he served in the Marines from 1942 till 1946--and again saw action during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. For two years in the early 1960s, Davidson edited <i>The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction</i>. He earned awards and accolades throughout his life for his SF writing, including the Hugo Award, the Edgar Award, the Ellery Queen Award, and three World Fantasy Awards. Davidson died in 1993.Adult/High School&#x2014;This collection of short essays is a real treasure. Davidson explains the origins of 15 myths, including werewolves, dragons, mermaids, unicorns, where Sinbad actually sailed, and the phoenix. He agrees with Kipling, whom he quotes as noting: "There are nine and sixty ways/Of constructing tribal lays/And every single one of them is right!" Kipling is just one of the many authors, historians, and philosophers to whom the well-read and eclectic Davidson turns to support the suppositions he himself posits about the "true" origins of each myth. He sometimes pits classic explainers against one another, as in the essay explaining the root of lycanthropy: one could find it in "Bulfinch's Mythology, but Rabelais is more fun." Each aside and every digression offer another path to follow or connection to make. The author's narrative prose itself invites sharing aloud, serving as a great model for student writers. Not only is this a wonderful resource for information on myths and legends, but it also comes with the bonuses of real literary adventures and some of the most entertaining nonfiction writing in the realm of popular culture.&#x2014;<i>Dana Cobern-Kullman, Luther Burbank Middle School, Burbank, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hers is an important job, for the folks along her treacherous route are eager for the tattered books and magazines she carries in her saddlebags.</p><p>During the Great Depression, thousands lived on the brink of starvation. Many perished. In 1935 President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Works Progess Administration under his 1933 New Deal initiative. The WPA was designed to get people back on their feet. One of its most innovative programs was the Pack Horse Library Project of Eastern Kentucky.</p><p>Thoroughly researched and illustrated with period photographs, this is the story of one of the WPA's greatest successes. People all over the country supported the project's goals. But it was the librarians themselves -- young, determined, and earning just $28 a month -- who brought the hope of a wider world to people in the crooks and hollows of Kentucky's Cumberland Mountains.</p></p><p><p>Kathi Appelt is the award-winning author of many children's books, including <em>Bat Jamboree</em>, illustrated by Melissa Sweet, and <em>Incredible Me!</em>, illustrated by G. Brian Karas. Ms. Appelt teaches creative writing to both children and adults and lives in College Station, Texas.</p><p>Gr 4-6-Imagine a cold, steep trip up a mountain path; it is icy and a light rain falls. A woman is riding an old horse and has a bag full of books to deliver. The families she stops to see are waiting for her, a one-room schoolhouse full of children greet her at the door. One woman walks nine miles to meet her and exchange her books and magazines. This is a day in the life of a pack-horse librarian. From 1935 to 1943, local Kentucky women were paid a meager salary as part of the WPA to do just this. Appelt and Schmitzer present an in-depth look at this unusual book-delivery system. With clear, thorough information, they take readers back to Depression-era Appalachia. Details of the project, such as why local women were the best choice to deliver the books, how materials were obtained, and how the delivery circuit worked, are offered in a readable format. The authors capably describe the isolated and poverty-ridden lives of the Kentucky mountain folk. Generously illustrated with black-and-white photographs, this book paints a complete picture of one WPA project. Extensive source notes are included.

There was no corpse, no witnesses, no evidence. But her uncle, Henrik, is convinced that she was murdered by someone from her own deeply dysfunctional family. Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired to investigate, but he quickly finds himself in over his head. He hires a competent assistant: the gifted and conscience-free computer specialist Lisbeth Salander, and the two unravel a dark and appalling family history. But the Vangers are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, September 2008</strong>: Once you start <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, there's no turning back. This debut thriller--the first in a trilogy from the late Stieg Larsson--is a serious page-turner rivaling the best of Charlie Huston and Michael Connelly. Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch--and there's always a catch--is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really <em>don't</em> want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo. --<em>Dave Callanan</em><br><br><b>Stieg Larsson</b> (1954-2004) was the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine Expo from 1999, and had previously worked at a major news agency for many years.

"Like pasta, scarves can be created with little effort and few basic materials," she writes. While this is true, the patterns found here are largely for intermediate and advanced knitters, though all knitters will appreciate the beauty and complexity of these designs.

For what Taleb calls the &#34;antifragile&#34; is actually beyond the robust, because it benefits from shocks, uncertainty, and stressors, just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension. The antifragile needs disorder in order to survive and flourish. Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, even necessary, and proposes that things be built in an antifragile manner. The antifragile is immune to prediction errors. Why is the city-state better than the nation-state, why is debt bad for you, and why is everything that is both modern and complicated bound to fail? The audiobook spans innovation by trial and error, health, biology, medicine, life decisions, politics, foreign policy, urban planning, war, personal finance, and economic systems. And throughout, in addition to the street wisdom of Fat Tony of Brooklyn, the voices and recipes of ancient wisdom, from Roman, Greek, Semitic, and medieval sources, are heard loud and clear. Extremely ambitious and multidisciplinary, Antifragile provides a blueprint for how to behave - and thrive - in a world we don&#39;t understand, and which is too uncertain for us to even try to understand and predict. Erudite and witty, Taleb&#39;s message is revolutionary: What is not antifragile will surely perish.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2012</strong>: Fragile things break under stress. But, according to Nassim Nicholas Taleb, there's an entire class of other things that don't simply resist stress but actually grow, strengthen, or otherwise gain from unforeseen and otherwise unwelcome stimuli. Taleb sees degrees of antifragility everywhere, from fasting, mythology, and urban planning to economic, technological, cultural, and biological systems. The wealth of radical thinking in this book astounds; the glossary alone offered more thought-provoking ideas than any other nonfiction book I read this year. That said, <i>Antifragile</i> is far from flawless. As comical as Taleb's rough handling of his favorite targets can be--academics, economists, and tourists, to name a few--his argumentative style boasts gaping holes, non sequiturs aplenty, and at times an almost willfully repugnant tone. Some readers will find Taleb's brashness off-putting; others will embrace it as a charismatic component of the ideas themselves. Either way, no one will finish this book unchanged. --<i>Jason Kirk</i><b>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</b> has devoted his life to problems of uncertainty, probability, and knowledge.

On the way, he was arrested and imprisoned-an incarceration that lasted thirteen years. Despite tremendous risk, Van Thuan refused to remain passive. During his nights in prison, lie wrote encouraging messages to the Vietnamese people. These brief reflections, scribbled on scraps of paper, were smuggled out of prison, copied by hand and circulated within the community. Bishop Van Thuan was thus able to remain connected to his people in a hidden yet powerful way. The Road of Hope is the collection of these 1,001 messages, a true "gospel from prison," written to console and strengthen a weary people in a war-torn land.

In this fascinating, eye-opening book, written with the service&#x2019;s full cooperation, he shares his experiences and takes us on a fascinating tour of this extraordinary organization&#x2014;the oldest, the most effective, and the most dangerous branch of American law enforcement, and the least known.</p><p>Unlike their counterparts in the police and the FBI, U.S. Marshals aren&#x2019;t responsible for investigating or prosecuting crimes. They pursue and arrest the most dangerous criminal offenders on U.S. soil, an extraordinarily hazardous job often involving gun battles and physical altercations. Earp takes us back to the service&#x2019;s early days, explaining its creation and its role in the border wars that helped make continental expansion possible. He brings to life the gunslingers and gunfights that have made the Marshals legend, and explores the service&#x2019;s role today integrating federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in the hunt for the most notorious criminals&#x2014;terrorists, drug lords, gun runners.</p><p>Setting his own experiences within the long history of the U.S. Marshals service, Earp offers a moving and illuminating tribute to the brave marshals who have dedicated their lives to keeping the nation safe.</p></p><p><p><b></b></p> <b>Top 5 Things You Didn&#x2019;t Know About the U. S. Marshals Service</b> <p></p> <p>1. Today, the U. S. Marshals Service is the leading apprehension force in America. Each year, marshals track down and arrest more felons than any other law enforcement agency in America, and more than every other federal law enforcement agency&#x2014;FBI, CIA, DEA, ATF, Border Patrol, TSA, Military Police&#x2014;combined. In 2012 the Marshals apprehended 122,900 fugitives, including 3,962 who were wanted for murder.</p> <p> 2. The U. S. Marshals Service is America's oldest law enforcement agency, established in 1789 by George Washington, who called for "the selection of the fittest characters to expound the law and dispense justice. " Legendary real-life marshals include Wyatt Earp and Bass Reeves. Famous fictional marshals are Matt Dillon, Elmore Leonard's Raylan Givens, and Rooster Cogburn, played by John Wayne in True Grit.</p> <p>3. The fugitives arrested by the modern Marshals Service are career criminals who have an average of four felony convictions each. More than half of them were classified violent offenders&#x2014;murder, aggravated assault and armed robbery. Jail is the last place they want to return to, meaning a U. S. marshal on their trail is their worst nightmare. </p> <p>4. Working in the U. S. Marshals Service is the most dangerous job in American law enforcement. More than 200 men and women have been killed while on the job. In 2012, for example, two deputies, five task force officers, and two canine officers were killed and five more were shot and wounded. This does not include all those deputies who were shot at but not hit, nor those men and women who suffered other injuries, including being run over by vehicles, hit by hard objects, and simply assaulted. The first law enforcement officer killed in the line of duty was U. S. Marshal Robert Forsyth in 1794 in Augusta, GA. </p> <p>5. The Old West tradition of deputizing citizens to form a posse and chase the bad guys has been updated and enabled the Marshals Service to form task forces. Unique in law enforcement, the Marshals Service has formed 7 regional and 60 local fugitive task forces. The task forces under the direction of deputy marshals include contributing officers from any local, state of federal law enforcement agency that chooses to participate. Contributors are permanently assigned to the task force and bring into it the most difficult cases of their agency. After being trained they also have national arrest authority, so while normally an NYPD officer cannot arrest anyone outside New York&#x2019;s borders, after being deputized he or she has national arrest authority. At various times the Marshals Service stages what are known as Falcon Operations, week-long national dragnets in which all regions attempt to locate and arrest as many fugitives as possible. This is Hell Week for fugitives. Incredibly, while the general public was completely unaware this was even going on, the one-week Operation Falcon 2009 resulted in the arrest of 35,190 fugitives, including 443 murder suspects.</p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <p><b></b></p> <p></p> <br> <p><b></b></p> <p></p><p>Deputy U.S. Marshal: How often did you draw your gun?<br>Retiring FBI Agent: Never.

Of that number, 3,962 were charged with murder, most were violent career criminals, and all were on the run from the authorities.

Based on interviews with more than fifty current and former deputies, as well as Earp's personal case notes, here are the greatest cases, hairiest arrests, and most unforgettable moments, all revealed for the first time. Here also is a history of how the marshals of legend have evolved into the country's frontline law enforcement agency, charged with apprehending the most notorious and dangerous suspects. </p><p>The U.S. Marshals Service is America's oldest law enforcement agency, established in 1789 by George Washington, who called for "the selection of the fittest characters to expound the law and dispense justice." It has had a long and colorful history, famously interwoven into the mythology of the Wild West, with notable real-life marshals like Wyatt Earp and Bass Reeves and legendary fictional characters like Matt Dillon, Elmore Leonard's Raylan Givens, and Rooster Cogburn, played by John Wayne in the 1969 film <em>True Grit</em>.</p><p>However, what few people realize is that in the past three decades the marshals have been at the heart of a transformation of the entire structure of law enforcement in America. The Marshals Service has become the most effective U.S. law enforcement agency, responsible for tracking down the nation's most wanted fugitives. Organized under the Department of Justice, the marshals serve as the apprehension arm for most federal agencies, including the FBI and the DEA, and across the nation U.S. Marshals regional task forces aid state and local law enforcement authorities to catch the most dangerous fugitives. All told, the Marshals Service processes more than 150,000 warrants each year, and deputies make an average of 337 arrests <em>per day</em>. They are also charged with transporting federal prisoners, protecting judges, and operating the Witness Security Program.</p><p>This is the untold story of the <em>new</em> U.S. Marshals Service, as seen through the eyes of the men and women who were pivotal in solving many of the most high-profile and dangerous cases in recent history.</p></p><h2>Sports Illustrated 50 Years: The Anniversary Book</h2><p>A fiftieth anniversary compilation of the best from the Sports Illustrated archives features memorable photographs and articles from the pages of the popular sports magazine since its launch in 1954, offering an entertaining and informative look at great moments in American sports history. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>This colorful book celebrating fifty years of America's most prominent sports magazine is certainly more practical than hoarding 2,500 issues. The six-part book plays to the strength of the magazine: "The Stories" and "The Photographs" sections are the largest. The 35 articles are truncated, often just whetting your appetite for more. The companion book <i>Fifty Years of Great Writing</i> offers many of these in their full glory. On the other hand, the pictures are often bigger than they were in the magazine (or could ever have been with the smaller size). Lose minutes staring at Michael Jordan or Walter Payton frozen in midair. Examine the juxtaposition of a close play at the plate with the bizarre styles of a 60s women's track team. Try not to be swept away at a shot of Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain defining basketball. If you have picked up the special issues released during <i>SI's</i> anniversary year, you already seen a decent portion of this book. The notable new writing is Richard Hoffer's essay about the world (both sports and at large) when the magazine began in 1954 and senior editor Frank Deford's pitch-perfect introduction about why the magazine is special and how it grew up in the age of television. The section most folks will spend their coffee table moments is "The Covers," a listing of the entire magazine's cover images, both in chronological order and grouped in similar topics (Scandals, Presidents, Deja Vu). Punctuated by the best sport quotes, <i>SI's</i> "Signs of the Apocalypse," fascinating lists of athletes and teams that were on the cover the most times, and other sport tidbits through the ages, this area is sure to launch a thousand sport memories. Yes, all the swimsuit covers are in one place, too. One quibble: why is their "Sports Person of the Year" in the book not the same as their well-known "Sportsman of the Year?" <i>--Doug Thomas</i>When <i>Sports Illustrated</i> first arrived in August 1954, its focus was fringe pursuits like yachting, bowling and dogs&#x2014;yet it struck a nerve. America was in a postwar economic boom and at the dawn of the TV age. "Sports was suddenly so much more visible, so much more important," says veteran sportswriter Frank Deford in his introduction. This book shows how <i>SI</i> has continued to foster sports' visibility, offering an engaging celebration of the last 50 years of American sports (and of <i>SI</i>'s own history), flush with fabulous photos: a toothless Jack Lambert; Muhammad Ali's wrinkled masseur, Luis Sarria; the Pittsburgh Pirates' Dave Parker enjoying a smoke after winning the 1979 World Series. What puts this book a notch above the average coffee-table book are the thoughtful sportswriting excerpts pulled from the magazine's archives. In one piece, up-and-comer Howard Cosell chastises the wimps and pretty boys who populate his profession. Another profiles former Chicago White Sox president and huckster Bill Veeck, who once sent a midget up to the plate to pinch-hit as a publicity stunt. Further chapters feature <i>SI</i> paintings&#x2014;many of them caricatures, like the one of disenchanted fans pelting a bug-eyed Bud Selig with baseballs&#x2014;and thumbnails of all 2,585 <i>SI</i> covers. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One of Lucy Maud Montgomery&#39;s only novels intended for an adult audience, The Blue Castle is filled with humour and romance.</p><p>At twenty-nine Valancy had never been in love, and it seemed romance had passed her by. Living with her overbearing mother and meddlesome aunt, she found her only consolations in the &#34;forbidden&#34; books of John Foster and her daydreams of the Blue Castle. Then a letter arrived from Dr. Trent -- and Valancy decided to throw caution to the winds. For the first time in her life Valancy did and said exactly what she wanted. Soon she discovered a surprising new world, full of love and adventures far beyond her most secret dreams.Lucy Maud Montgomery CBE, (always called "Maud" by family and friends) and publicly known as L. M. Montgomery, (November 30, 1874&#x2013;April 24, 1942) was a Canadian author, best known for a series of novels beginning with Anne of Green Gables, published in 1908. Once published, Anne of Green Gables was an immediate success. The central character, Anne, an orphaned girl, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. The first novel was followed by a series of sequels with Anne as the central character. The novels became the basis for the highly acclaimed 1985 CBC television miniseries, Anne of Green Gables and several other television movies and programs, including Road to Avonlea, which ran in Canada and the U.S. from 1990-1996.</p><h2>Greenhouse Gardening: Step by Step to Growing Success (Crowood Gardening Guides)</h2><p>Crowood Gardening Guides have become the indispensable handbooks for the keen gardener who wants his information clear, practical, and full of color.

As the nation is struggling to come to peace with itself, all Vanessa Clemens can think about is her birthday. She has been dreading it for weeks, for the day she turns fourteen she must leave the orphanage that has been her home for a decade. The headmaster has made arrangements for Nessa. Either she can become a servant or marry the pastor, an older dreary man. Those are her only options. Then, on her birthday morning, Nessa hears cries flooding the sleepy Missouri town: President Lincoln has been assassinated. This national tragedy spurs her to flee on the first stagecoach heading West, determined not to be a servant or unloved wife.<br><br>This is #1 in the series.</p><p>Kristiana Gregory grew up in Manhattan Beach, California, two blocks from the ocean. She's always loved to make up stories [ask her family!], telling her younger siblings whoppers that would leave them wide-eyed and shivering. Her first rejection letter at age ten was for a poem she wrote in class when she was supposed to be doing a math assignment. She's had a myriad of odd jobs: telephone operator, lifeguard, camp counselor, reporter, book reviewer &amp; columnist for the LA Times, and finally author. Her award-winning books include STALKED, which earned the 2012 Gold Medal for Young Adult Mystery from Literary Classics and is hailed as "historical fiction with a thrilling twist." KIRKUS calls it "an atmospheric confection that will thrill YA readers ... Gregory achieves a realistic, rich atmosphere with insightful details about the immigration process and New York tenements in the early 1900s." Now available on Kindle and in paperback. JENNY OF THE TETONS [Harcourt] won the Golden Kite Award in 1989 and was the first of two-dozen historical novels for middle grade readers. Several of Kristiana's titles are now available on Kindle including "Curiously Odd Stories: Vol. 1 and Vol. 2" with the celebrated 'Paper Monument', a futuristic book-banning with horrific consequences. MY DARLIN' CLEMENTINE [Holiday House] takes place in an Idaho mining camp of 1866, based on the song of that name, and was Idaho's top pick for the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C. BRONTE'S BOOK CLUB [HH] is set in a town by the sea and is inspired by the girls' book club Kristiana led for several years. Her most recent title with Scholastic's Dear America series is CANNONS AT DAWN, a sequel to the best-selling THE WINTER OF RED SNOW, which was made into a movie for the HBO Family Channel. Kristiana and her husband have two adult sons, and live in Idaho with their two golden retrievers. In her spare time she loves to swim, walk, hike, read, and hang out with friends. She's trying to learn to knit, but isn't yet having much success. Check out Kristiana's blogs at http://notesfromthesunroom.blogspot.com/ for behind-the-scenes stories about her books, and with photos from her childhood.Grade 4-6-Nessa Clemens has lived in an orphanage in Missouri for as long as she can remember, but Mr. Carey has a strict rule that children must leave at age 14. Nessa has been promised as a bride to the Reverend McDuff, and her 14th birthday is just days away. The reverend has told her that it is God's will that she become his wife, but she is not willing to enter a loveless marriage. She runs away by stagecoach to Prairie River, KS. Once there, she faces the constant fear that someone will send her back to Missouri, causing her to keep to herself and not share in the confidences of those who would be her friends. Through it all, her faith keeps her strong as she tries to make a new life for herself. In this first book in the series, Gregory has created strong, realistic Christian characters. Nessa's world, an 1865 prairie settlement town, is rich in description and historical detail. Nessa's faith, apparent throughout the book in the prayers she writes, scripture verses, and hymn lyrics, is not overwhelming, but rather flows with the narrative. An enjoyable story with a memorable protagonist.<br><i>Heather E.

She has been acting for over forty years both on television and the West End stage.'You know what?' said Major Dexter Smythe to the octopus. 'You're going to have a real treat today if I can manage it.' <p>He had spoken aloud and his breath had steamed up the glass of his Pirelli mask. He put his feet down to the sand and stood up. The water reached to his armpits. He took off the mask and spat into it, rubbed the spit round the glass, rinsed it clean and pulled the rubber band of the mask back over his head. He bent down again.</p> <p>The eye in the mottled brown sack was still watching him carefully from the hole in the coral, but now the tip of a single small tentacle wavered hesitatingly an inch or two out of the shadows and quested vaguely with its pink suckers uppermost. Dexter Smythe smiled with satisfaction. Given time, perhaps one more month on top of the two during which he had been chumming up with the octopus, and he would have tamed the darling. But he wasn't going to have that month. Should he take a chance today and reach down and offer his hand, instead of the expected lump of raw meat on the end of his spear, to the tentacle - shake it by the hand, so to speak? No, Pussy, he thought. I can't quite trust you yet. Almost certainly other tentacles would whip out of the hole and up his arm. He only needed to be dragged down less than two feet, the cork valve on his mask would automatically close and he would be suffocated inside it or, if he tore it off, drowned. He might get in a quick lucky jab with his spear, but it would take more than that to kill Pussy. No. Perhaps later in the day. It would be rather like playing Russian roulette, and at about the same five-to-one-odds. It might be a quick, a whimsical way out of his troubles! But not now. It would leave the interesting question unsolved. And he had promised that nice Professor Bengry at the Institute. Dexter Smythe swam leisurely off towards the reef, his eyes questing for one shape only, the squat sinister wedge of a scorpion fish, or, as Bengry would put it, Scorpaena Plumieri.</p> <p>Major Dexter Smythe, OBE, Royal Marines (Retd), was the remains of a once brave and resourceful officer and of a handsome man who had made easy sexual conquests all his military life and particularly among the Wrens and Wracs and ATS who manned the com-munications and secretariat of the very special task force to which he had been attached at the end of his service career. Now he was fifty-four, slightly bald and his belly sagged in the Jantzen trunks. And he had had two coronary thromboses. His doctor, Jimmy Greaves (who had been one of their high poker game at Queen's Club when Dexter Smythe had first come to Jamaica), had half-jocularly described the later one, only a month before, as 'the second warning'. But, in his well-chosen clothes, his varicose veins out of sight and his stomach flattened by a discreet support belt behind an immaculate cummerbund, he was still a fine figure of a man at a cocktail party or dinner on the North Shore, and it was a mystery to his friends and neighbours why, in defiance of the two ounces of whisky and ten cigarettes a day to which his doctor had rationed him, he persisted in smoking like a chimney and going to bed drunk, if amiably drunk, every night.</p> <p>The truth of the matter was that Dexter Smythe had arrived at the frontier of the death-wish. The origins of this state of mind were many and not all that complex. He was irretrievably tied to Jamaica, and tropical sloth had gradually riddled him so that while outwardly he appeared a piece of fairly solid hardwood, under the varnished surface the termites of sloth, self-indulgence, guilt over an ancient sin and general disgust with himself had eroded his once hard core into dust. Since the death of Mary two years before, he had loved no one. He wasn't even sure that he had really loved her, but he knew that, every hour of the day, he missed her love of him and her gay, untidy, chiding and often irritating presence, and though he ate their canapes and drank their martinis, he had nothing but contempt for the international riff-raff with whom he consorted on the North Shore. He could perhaps have made friends with the soldier elements, the gentleman-farmers inland, or the plantation owners on the coast, the professional men and the politicians, but that would mean regaining some serious purpose in life which his sloth, his spiritual accidie, prevented, and cutting down on the bottle, which he was definitely unwilling to do. So Major Smythe was bored, bored to death, and, but for one factor in his life, he would long ago have swallowed the bottle of barbiturates he had easily acquired from a local doctor. The lifeline that kept him clinging to the edge of the cliff was a tenuous one. Heavy drinkers veer towards an exaggeration of their basic temperaments, the classic four - Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Choleric and Melancholic. The Sanguine drunk goes gay to the point of hysteria and idiocy. The Phlegmatic sinks into a morass of sullen gloom. The Choleric is the fighting drunk of the cartoonists who spends much of his life in prison for smashing people and things, and the Melancholic succumbs to self-pity, mawkishness and tears. Major Smythe was a Melancholic who had slid into a drooling fantasy woven around the birds and insects and fish that inhabited the five acres of Wavelets (the name he had given his small villa is symptomatic), its beach and the coral reef beyond. The fish were his particular favourites. He referred to them as 'people' and, since reef fish stick to their territories as closely as do most small birds, after two years he knew them all intimately, 'loved' them and believed that they loved him in return.</p> <p>They certainly knew him, as the denizens of zoos know their keepers, because he was a daily and a regular provider, scraping off algae and stirring up the sand and rocks for the bottom-feeders, breaking up sea eggs and urchins for the small carnivores and bringing out scraps of offal for the larger ones, and now, as he swam slowly and heavily up and down the reef and through the channels that led out to deep water, his 'people' swarmed around him fearlessly and expectantly, darting at the tip of the three-pronged spear they knew only as a prodigal spoon, flirting right up to the glass of the Pirelli and even, in the case of the fearless, pugnacious demoiselles, nipping softly at his feet and legs. Part of Major Smythe's mind took in all these brilliantly coloured little 'people', but today he had a job to do and while he greeted them in unspoken words - 'Morning, Beau Gregory' to the dark-blue demoiselle sprinkled with bright-blue spots, the 'jewel fish' that exactly resembles the starlit fashioning of a bottle of Worth's 'Vol de Nuit'; 'Sorry. Not today, sweetheart,' to a fluttering butterfly fish with false black 'eyes' on its tail and, 'You're too fat anyway, Blue Boy,' to an indigo parrot fish that must have weighed a good ten pounds - his eyes were searching for only one of his 'people' - his only enemy on the reef, the only one he killed on sight, a scorpion fish.</p> <p>Scorpion fish inhabit most of the southern waters of the world, and the 'rascasse' that is the foundation of bouillabaisse belongs to the family. The West Indian variety runs up to only about twelve inches long and perhaps a pound in weight. It is by far the ugliest fish in the sea, as if nature were giving warning. It is a mottled brownish grey with a heavy, wedge-shaped shaggy head. It has fleshy pendulous 'eyebrows' that droop over angry red eyes and a coloration and broken silhouette that are perfect camouflage on the reef. Though a small fish, its heavily toothed mouth is so wide that it can swallow whole most of the smaller reef fishes, but its supreme weapon lies in its erectile dorsal fins, the first few of which, acting on contact like hypodermic needles, are fed by poison glands containing enough tetrodotoxin to kill a man if they merely graze him in a vulnerable spot - in an artery, for instance, or over the heart or in the groin. They constitute the only real danger to the reef swimmer, far more dangerous than barracuda or shark, because, supremely confident in their camouflage and armoury, they flee before nothing except the very close approach of a foot or actual contact. Then they flit only a few yards on wide and bizarrely striped pectorals and settle again watchfully either on the sand, where they look like a lump of overgrown coral, or amongst the rocks and seaweed, where they virtually disappear. And Major Smythe was determined to find one, spear it and give it to his octopus to see if it would take or spurn it, see if one of the ocean's great predators would recognize the deadliness of another, know of its poison. Would the octopus consume the belly and leave the spines? Would it eat the lot and, if so, would it suffer from the poison? These were the questions Bengry at the Institute wanted answered and today, since it was going to be the beginning of the end of Major Smythe's life at Wavelets and though it might mean the end of his darling Octopussy, Major Smythe had decided to find out the answers and leave one tiny memorial to his now futile life in some dusty corner of the Institute's marine biological files.</p> <p>For, only a couple of hours earlier, Major Dexter Smythe's already dismal life had changed very much for the worse. So much for the worse that he would be lucky if, in a few weeks' time - time for the sending of cables from Government House to the Colonial Office, to be relayed to the Secret Service and thence to Scotland Yard and the Public Prosecutor, and for Major Smythe's transportation to London with a police escort - he got away with a sentence of imprisonment for life.</p> <p>And all this because of a man called Bond, Commander James Bond, who had turned up at ten thirty that morning in a taxi from Kingston.</p> <p>The day had started normally. Major Smythe had awoken from his Seconal sleep, swallowed a couple of Panadols (his heart condition forbade him aspirin), showered and skimped his breakfast under the umbrella-shaped sea-almonds and spent an hour feeding the remains of his breakfast to the birds. He then took his prescribed doses of anti-coagulant and blood-pressure pills and killed time with the Daily Gleaner until he could have his elevenses which, for months now, he had advanced to ten thirty. He had just poured himself the first of two stiff brandies and ginger ales, 'the drunkard's drink', when he heard the car coming up the drive.</p> <p>Luna, his coloured housekeeper, came out into the garden and announced, 'Gemmun to see you, Major.'</p> <p>'What's his name?'</p> <p>'Him doan say. Major. Him say to tell you him come from Govment House.'</p> <p>Major Smythe was wearing nothing but a pair of old khaki shorts and sandals. He said, 'All right, Luna. Put him in the living room and say I won't be a moment,' and went round the back way into his bedroom and put on a white bush shirt and trousers and brushed his hair. Government House! Now what the hell?</p> <p>As soon as he had walked through into the living-room and seen the tall man in the dark-blue tropical suit standing at the picture window looking out to sea, Major Smythe had somehow sensed bad news. Then, when the man had turned slowly to look at him with watchful, serious blue-grey eyes, he had known that this was officialdom, and when his cheery smile was not returned, inimical officialdom. A chill had run down Major Smythe's spine. 'They' had somehow found out.</p> <p>'Well, well. I'm Smythe. I gather you're from Government House. How's Sir Kenneth?'</p> <p>There was somehow no question of shaking hands. The man said, 'I haven't met him. I only arrived a couple of days ago. I've been out round the island most of the time. My name's Bond, James Bond. I'm from the Ministry of Defence.'</p> <p>Major Smythe remembered the hoary euphemism for the Secret Service. He said, with forced cheerfulness, 'Oh. The old firm?'</p> <p>The question had been ignored. 'Is there somewhere we can talk?'</p> <p>'Rather. Anywhere you like. Here or in the garden? What about a drink?' Major Smythe clinked the ice in the glass he still held in his hand.' Rum and ginger's the local poison. I prefer the ginger by itself. 'The lie came out with the automatic smoothness of the alcoholic.</p> <p>' No thanks. And here would be fine.' The man leaned 5negligently against the wide mahogany windowsill.</p> <p>Major Smythe sat down and threw a jaunty leg over the low arm of one of the comfortable planters' chairs he had had copied from an original by the local cabinet-maker. He pulled out the drink coaster from the other 1arm, took a deep pull at his glass and slid it, with a consciously steady hand, down into the hole in the wood. 'Well,' he said cheerily, looking the other man straight in the eyes,'what can I do for you? Somebody been up to some dirty work on the North Shore and you need a spare hand? Be glad to get into harness again. It's been a long time since those days, but I can still remember some of the old routines.'</p> <p>'Do you mind if I smoke?' The man had already got his cigarette case in his hand. It was a flat gun-metal one that would hold a round fifty. Somehow this small sign of a shared weakness comforted Major Smythe.</p> <p>'Of course, my dear fellow.' He made a move to get up, his lighter ready. 'It's all right, thanks.' James Bond had already lit his cigarette. 'No, it's nothing local. I want to, I've been sent out to ask you to recall your work for the Service at the end of the war.' James Bond paused and looked down at Major Smythe carefully. 'Particularly the time when you were working with the Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau.'</p> <p>Major Smythe laughed sharply. He had known it. He had known it for absolutely sure. But when it came out of this man's mouth, the laugh had been forced out of Major Smythe like the scream of a hit man. 'Oh Lord, yes. Good old MOB. That was a lark all right.' He laughed again. He felt the anginal pain, brought on by the pressure of what he knew was coming, build up across his chest. He dipped his hand into his trouser pocket, tilted the little bottle into the palm of his hand and slipped the white TNT pill under his tongue. He was amused to see the tension coil up in the other man, the way the eyes narrowed watchfully. It's all right, my dear fellow. This isn't a death pill. He said, 'You troubled with acidosis? No? It slays me when I go on a bender. Last night. Party at Jamaica Inn. One really ought to stop thinking one's always twenty-five. Anyway, let's get back to MOB Force. Not many of us left, I suppose.'

But John&#39;s message is relevant for vital Christian life in any age. This exposition attempts to interpret Revelation from within the context of its meaning to its original audience. At the same time, however, it recognizes that the vision, though written in the imagery of John&#39;s day, is concerned with the ultimate spiritual realities that govern all human existence without regard to any particular period of history. John&#39;s vision reveals the dynamics of Christian life in a world whose values, perspectives, and structures are alien and destructive to the wholeness of life in Christ. He sees this in two principal images: New Jerusalem and Fallen Babylon. Throughout the vision, human wholeness (holiness) is undertood to have its source in New Jerusalem, and Fallen Babylon is seen as a realm of existence whose dehumanizing and manipulative dynamics (unholiness) are destructive of human wholeness. The implications for our understanding and experience of the deeper dynamics of Christian life in the present day are staggering. Revelation, perhaps more than any other New Testament book, discloses the deepest dimensions of Christian life and activity in the world. It awakens us to who we are and what we ought to be.</p><p></p><h2>Good News Bible: Deadline Strips of Shaky Kane</h2><p>This major retrospective of comics and illustration from essential British cartoonist Shaky Kane collects the entirety of his work from the classic '90s magazine Deadline for the first time.

He could feel it pulling into lines of complete blank shock.</p><p>Fascination.</p><p>Lust.</p><p>He should move. He told himself to move as he clenched his fists and pressed them into the wall beside the small attic window.</p><p>He was going to move.</p><p>In just a minute.</p><p>Just as soon as he came in his jeans from the sight that met his bemused eyes.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t his fault.</p><p>He was excusing himself and he damned well knew it. He was just too... shell-shocked. Yeah, that was the word. Too shell-shocked to move a single muscle and drag himself away from the little window with a bird&#x2019;s-eye view into the neighbors&#x2019; secluded backyard.</p><p>Pervert! he railed at himself.</p><p>That didn&#x2019;t stop him. He was transfixed. His cock was in hell. He was practically drooling on his dusty attic floor as he watched shy little priss, Miss Sarah Fox, naked as God created her.</p><p>Glistening beneath the sun, slender hands moving.</p><p>He closed his eyes. Swallowed tightly. She thought she was in the privacy of her own home. She thought that sheltering fence she&#x2019;d paid a fucking fortune to have built around her pool was tall enough to protect her. That no one could see her. That she was safe.</p><p>He opened his eyes.</p><p>He felt sweat bead on his forehead and roll down his temple as she smoothed her hands over her breasts. Cupped them. Rolled her nipples.</p><p>&#x201c;Christ,&#x201c; he wheezed. There was a flash of gold.</p><p>Holy hell.</p><p>He felt his cock get impossibly thicker. Felt his balls tighten. His balls? Damn. He could barely breathe.</p><p>Prissy Miss Fox had nipple rings. Fucking nipple rings. Beneath those staid blouses and too-long damned skirts she wore, she was wearing fucking nipple rings?</p><p>His fists tightened as he pressed them into the window frame. He blinked back sweat, and he couldn&#x2019;t drag his eyes away from her.</p><p>Long nut-brown, riotously curly hair fanned around her. A hell of a lot longer than he had imagined it was. And she was curved. Curved where a woman should be curved.</p><p>And her fingers.</p><p>He tried to swallow. Her fingers were pulling at the little gold piercings in her nipples, and her expression was filled with pleasure.</p><p>Her entire body was sheened with oil. He forced his eyes from her nipples. Down.</p><p>&#x201c;God have mercy.&#x201d; He was breathing fast, hard.</p><p>Fine. He was a fucking pervert. He unzipped his jeans, dragged free his dick, and curled his fingers around the shaft, palming it, stroking it.</p><p>Because, she was moving again. The fingers of one hand were trailing down her stomach, to her bare, waxed, glistening...</p><p>He leaned his forehead against the little circular window, stared, fought to breathe. There was gold there, too. Just a flash. Just enough to assure his very trained eye that Sarah Fox had a piercing at the hood of her clitoris.</p><p>And she was playing with it. Pulling at it. Stroking her clit with glistening fingers.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t writhe. She wasn&#x2019;t arching or giving him a show. She was a woman, lost in her own fantasy, her own touch. Her teeth clenched her lower lip, perspiration beaded her skin. Oil shimmered on it. And she was stroking herself. Slowly. Enjoying it. A woman who liked to be teased. Who liked the buildup. A slow hand.</p><p>He timed the strokes on his cock with the slender fingers moving between her thighs. Fine, he was fucking hard-core into watching the coolest little piece of flesh in town touching herself.</p><p>Damn. It was good. Who knew?</p><p>He stroked his cock, feeling her fingers on his flesh, slick, oil slick. He palmed the thick crown, feeling the steel that pierced the head of his cock, stroked down the shaft, and felt his chest tightening with the release building inside his balls.</p><p>And still she played.</p><p>His gaze narrowed on her. Her expression was almost distressed. Her fingers were moving faster now, stroking. His fingers stroked. His thumb raked over the curved steel beneath the head of his cock as he imagined the piercing in her clit.</p><p>Ah hell. Damn. He couldn&#x2019;t handle it. He watched. Her fingers, her face, the sweat that ran into her hair and then he blew. He felt the ragged growl that tore from his throat, the blistering curse as his come exploded from his balls, splattering against his fingers as Sarah&#x2019;s hips arched and her expression twisted.</p><p>In disappointment.</p><p>Her hand slapped the cement beside her. She sat up, pushed her fingers through her hair, then jerked to her feet and stalked back into her little house as Cooper stared at her in shock.</p><p>His come was cooling on his fingers and Sarah had been left disappointed?</p><p>He blinked down at the pool area as he absently grabbed an old T-shirt and wiped his fingers clean of his release, then his still-hard cock.</p><p>Fixing his jeans he stared out the window, narrowing his eyes. Most of the houses in the area were single story, with privacy fences built around them. It just so happened Cooper&#x2019;s was just a little bit taller than most to allow for a taller attic. Just tall enough, the window positioned just right to look down into her pool area.</p><p>For some unknown reason, there were few of the houses built on the same line in the little Southern Texas town. Just so happened, his was built just right.</p><p>He grinned at his luck. Then he frowned as he readjusted his jeans and moved to the door of the long attic and down the spiral, metal stairs that led down to the kitchen. Damn if Miss Fox hadn&#x2019;t just given him the release of the year or something.</p><p>The thought of her&#x2014;disappointed. Wet. Pierced.</p><p>Fuck. Pierced. Sarah Fox. The woman he assumed was a staid little virgin. At least, that was the rumor. Virgin? With those piercings? Not likely.</p><p>Satisfied was another thing entirely, and as much as he would have liked to, helping Miss Sarah find her release wasn&#x2019;t going to become his aim in life.</p><p>Ethan Cooper was the bad boy, and he knew it. He owned the local bar, a sometimes biker hangout and generally ill-reputed establishment. And he liked it that way.</p><p>He was ill-reputable. The local troublemaker turned bar owner after returning from the Army where he&#x2019;d served more than eight years. A bullet to his knee had put him out of the Rangers, but it hadn&#x2019;t put him out of life. A few scars and heavy pins in a reconstructed knee weren&#x2019;t enough to kill that untamed, sometimes dark core inside his soul.</p><p>The Army had honed it. The Rangers had sharpened it. Life itself may have darkened it further. But it was still there. He was still dangerous. He was still dark. He was still footloose and fancy-free. And he intended to stay that way.</p><p>Sarah threw the towel on her bed, pouted, and stomped to the shower. She washed the tanning oil from her body beneath the spray and sighed in exasperation at the need that still throbbed between her thighs.</p><p>Twenty-four years old. She was twenty-four years old and still a virgin. And as though everyone in this little town she had moved to knew it, she was still known as Miss Sarah. And she was tired of it.</p><p>She washed quickly, dried her hair vigorously before combing through the tangles and leaving the long, loose ringlets hanging to the middle of her back before moving back to the bedroom and breathing out roughly.</p><p>She&#x2019;d tried everything to make herself fit in here, in this little Texas town.</p><p>Well, everything but walking into a bar and just picking up a man and she just couldn&#x2019;t bring herself to do that. Just as she hadn&#x2019;t been able to bring herself to let one of the drunken frat boys from college heave and moan over her.</p><p>She grimaced at the thought of the parties her sorority sisters had dragged her to while in college. There had been a few boys who hadn&#x2019;t been drunk. Who had flirted with her, seemed interested. In a quick little screw.</p><p>She sat down on her bed and glared at her bedroom wall. She should have moved to a larger town. She made a damn good living as a Web designer and computer programmer. She worked for an excellent company. She had good benefits. She&#x2019;d been damn lucky. She didn&#x2019;t have to do the nine-to-five rush and could relax. She could afford to move to Houston or Dallas. The thought had her breath trapping in her throat. So many strangers. So much noise and fear. It was quieter here in Simsburg. A little, almost unknown, town outside of Corpus Christi. She could relax here.</p><p>Hide away.</p><p>Shaking her head, she rose from the bed and headed to the closet. She pulled one of the sleeveless dresses from the closet and slipped it over her head before buttoning it nearly to her neck.</p><p>She went back to the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror. She unbuttoned the dress, spread it back from her chest and stared.</p><p>The faint white lines were still there. She should stay out of the sun, she told herself as she let her fingers trace over the thin white scars. Tanning made them worse, she reminded herself. Made them easier to see. Harder to hide.</p><p>She let her fingers trace over them. There were half a dozen, long, narrow, very thin. But they were there. They had been there since she was sixteen years old. Sixteen and stupid.</p><p>She rebuttoned her dress before moving back to the bedroom and pulling on the bronze lace panties she took from her dresser. She slid her feet into sandals, twisted up her hair and secured it in a smooth twist at the back of her head before heading to the kitchen for her purse.</p><p>She locked the house quickly but securely as she stepped out on the front porch a few moments later. Even here, in the quaint little town, amid the little houses and friendly citizens, she didn&#x2019;t take chances. She kept her doors locked. Her windows locked. She kept her car locked.</p><p>Head down, she dug her keys out of her purse, raising her head just in time to see her neighbor driving into the driveway right beside hers.</p><p>The powerful steel-gray four-by-four ru...</p></p><h2>The Amazing Paper Cuttings of Hans Christian Andersen</h2><p>Hans Christian Andersen, the Danish storyteller whose fairy tales are known all over the world, was also a gifted artist. He made hundreds, perhaps thousands, of paper cuttings of swans, clowns, toy theaters, windmills, angels, and other whimsical images. Often he made the paper cuttings while telling a story, then gave them to the children listening to him. In this inspired biography, Beth Wagner Brust tells the story of Andersen as an artist who used his many talents to escape the poverty into which he was born and who entertained others with not only his famous stories but also his innovative and original art.</p><p>Beth Wagner Brust first discovered Andersen&#x2019;s paper cuttings at the Hans Christian Andersen Museum in Odense, Denmark. When she learned that many of them had been made as presents for young people, she decided to tell the story of Andersen as an artist. She lives in California.Grade 5 Up-As a storyteller, Andersen relied on simple language and dramatic gestures to tap the imagination of his listeners. Sometimes, it seems, he also supplemented his tellings with the making of paper cuttings, a popular craft in the mid-19th century. Brust provides a skeleton biography of Andersen using anecdotal reports of some of the occasions when he employed his handicraft to entertain children, capture a scene during his travels, and even as a sort of universal language when in a foreign country. The more than 20 reproductions demonstrate his imaginative use of materials. While none illustrate any of his stories, many cuttings demonstrate his skill in liberating intricate shapes and in designing complex, interlocking compositions. Nevertheless, the use of "amazing" in the title is a bit of an exaggeration. Rather, the book's value is in showing a little-known facet of the man's personality. The writing is direct and informative and uses quotations from letters and diaries to spice up the simple prose; the chapter on the art of paper cutting is a useful presentation of the technical processes. An unusual book that combines biography and creativity.<br><i>Kenneth Marantz, Art Education Department, Ohio State University, Columbus</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Rich Bitch: A Simple 12-Step Plan for Getting Your Financial Life Together...Finally</h2><p><p>In this <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, journalist and financial expert Nicole Lapin shows women how to take charge of their lives by taking charge of their money.</p><p>Do your eyes glaze over just thinking about the mumbo-jumbo language of finance?

In 1931, he became a pioneer in Christian radio on the Pacific Coast with his show Kenyon's Church of the Air, where he earned the moniker "The Faith Builder."

He was also subjected to vigorous discussion regarding the boundaries of medical ethics, which provided him a foundation for writing <i>Do No Harm.</i> In the course of researching the novel, he shadowed doctors in the UCLA emergency room, harassed government operatives to teach him surveillance techniques, and delved into psychological research on childhood trauma. <p><i>Minutes to Burn</i> originated during Hurwitz's research travel in the Gal�pagos, where he confronted marine iguanas on lava plains, hiked through the islands' curious Scalesia forests, and contended with enormous crab spiders in shower stalls and toilet bowls. Upon his return, he spent months tracking down scientific experts around the world -- ecologists, geologists, entomologists, virologists -- continuing to indulge his fascination in the archipelago and to flesh out what would become <i>Minutes to Burn.</i> While undertaking the military research for the novel, Hurwitz dealt with an extensive network of Navy SEALs and related operators. He was obligated to familiarize himself with sidearms, meals-ready-to-eat, M-16s, SWAT ranges, and hand-to-hand techniques -- much to the derisive amusement of attendant Navy SEALs.</p><p>Hurwitz grew up in the Bay Area. While completing a BA from Harvard and a master's from Oxford, he wrote his first novel, <i>The Tower,</i> a psychological thriller set in and around San Francisco.</p><p>Hurwitz has published several academic articles. He lives in Los Angeles, where he is working on his fourth thriller and the screenplay of <i>Rogue Warrior</i> (based on Richard Marcinko's autobiography) for Jerry Bruckheimer Films.</p>It is the year 2007, earthquakes rattle the globe, the ozone layer is shot and evolution kicks into overdrive in this gripping action-movie-in-waiting. Hurwitz has engineered a deft recombinant blend of a thriller, tossing in lots of scientific speculation ... la Crichton in Jurassic Park mode, a ragtag Navy SEAL crew reminiscent of the Aliens heroes, some Predator and a dash of Rambo. In his jam-packed tale, a rogue virus appears on one of the Gal&nbsp;pagos islands, and soon the remote archipelago is populated by nine-foot-tall man-eating monsters. Unaware of the infestation, scientists are sent from the U.S. to set up seismic sensors, and a team of seven Navy SEALs are assigned to escort them. Team members include husband-and-wife Justin and Cameron, who is not quite showing her pregnancy; squad leader Derek, having problems with concentration, much less command; and the gigantic Tank, among others. Most enjoyable is the 50ish knife-wielding Nam vet, Savage, who practically steals the book. Stranded on the island without guns after a series of screwups, the team is sucked into a nightmarish chase, turned from hunters to hunted and back again. Hurwitz's first novel, The Tower, was labeled a satire of serial killer novels by some reviewers. This page-turner keeps a satiric edge, too, while Hurwitz proves he is perfectly at home with toothy creatures on the rampage and a thrilling array of other soon-to-be FX.

Fascinated by the fact that little was known about the famous book&#x2019;s genesis, Hayes combed through nineteenth-century letters and medical-school records, learning that, besides Henry Gray, the brilliant scholar and surgeon who wrote the text, another anatomist was crucial to the book&#x2019;s popularity: Henry Vandyke Carter, who provided its painstaking drawings. Hayes moves nimbly between the dour streets of Victorian London, where Gray and Carter trained at St. George&#x2019;s Hospital, and the sunnier classrooms of a West Coast university filled with athletic physical therapists in training, where he enrolls in anatomy classes and discovers that &#x201c;when done well, dissection is very pleasing aesthetically.&#x201d; - <b><i>The New Yorker</i></b><br><br>"All laud and honor to Hayes....In perusing the body's 650 muscles and 206 bones, he has made the case that we are, as the psalmist wrote, "fearfully and wonderfully made" and that dissection has an aesthetic all its own. The act of carving open a body becomes, in this context, a perverse act of love, a desecration that consecrates "the extraordinary, the inner architecture of the human form." - <b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br>"How do you write a book about someone about whom next to nothing is known? For most writers, the answer would be move on to the next subject. But Bill Hayes has an unusual set of skills. The author of previous books on insomnia and blood, he is part science writer, part memoirist, part culture explainer. &#x201c;The Anatomist,&#x201d; his appealing new book about the man behind Gray&#x2019;s Anatomy, combines his search for the remaining traces of Henry Gray with a memoir of his own experience as a dissection student and a scalpel&#x2019;s-eye tour of the body." - <b><i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>"Some of [Hayes's] most memorable writing describes the dissection classes he attended in San Francisco. We are treated to a selection of fascinating anatomical snippets about, for example, how to trace evidence of the sealed hole in the fetal heart through which the mother's blood enters; or how to find the kidney in a cadaver; or that blood flowing out of the heart is first used to feed the heart itself; or, best of all, a structural analysis of how the Queen manages to deliver such a uniquely restrained wave." - <b><i>Nature: The International Weekly Journal of Science</i></b><br><br>The classic medical text known as <b>Gray&#x2019;s Anatomy</b> is one of the most famous books ever written. Now, on the 150th anniversary of its publication, acclaimed science writer and master of narrative nonfiction Bill Hayes has written the fascinating, never-before-told true story of how this seminal volume came to be. A blend of history, science, culture, and Hayes&#x2019;s own personal experiences, The Anatomist is this author&#x2019;s most accomplished and affecting work to date.<br><br>With passion and wit, Hayes explores the significance of <b>Gray&#x2019;s Anatomy</b> and explains why it came to symbolize a turning point in medical history. But he does much, much more. Uncovering a treasure trove of forgotten letters and diaries, he illuminates the astonishing relationship between the fiercely gifted young anatomist Henry Gray and his younger collaborator H. V. Carter, whose exquisite anatomical illustrations are masterpieces of art and close observation. Tracing the triumphs and tragedies of these two extraordinary men, Hayes brings an equally extraordinary era&#x2013;the mid-1800s&#x2013;unforgettably to life.<br><br>But the journey Hayes takes us on is not only outward but inward&#x2013;through the blood and tissue and organs of the human body&#x2013;for <b>The Anatomist<i> </i></b>chronicles Hayes&#x2019;s year as a student of classical gross anatomy, performing with his own hands the dissections and examinations detailed by Henry Gray 150 years ago. As Hayes&#x2019;s acquaintance with death deepens, he finds his understanding and appreciation of life deepening in unexpected and profoundly moving ways.<br><br><b>The Anatomist</b> is more than just the story of a book. It is the story of the human body, a story whose beginning and end we all know and share but that, like all great stories, is infinitely rich in between.</p><p>The recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in nonfiction, Bill Hayes is a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Times</i> and the author of four books: <i>Sleep Demons: An Insomniac&#x2019;s Memoir</i>, <i>Five Quarts: A Personal and Natural History of Blood</i>, <i>The Anatomist: A True Story of Gray&#x2019;s Anatomy</i>, and <i>Insomniac City: New York, Oliver, and Me&nbsp;</i>(coming February 2017), and is currently at work on a new book <i>Sweat: A History of Exercise.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> A photographer as well as a writer, his photos have appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Granta</i>, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and on CBS Evening News. &nbsp;His portraits of his partner, the late Oliver Sacks, appear in the recent collection of Dr. Sacks&#x2019;s suite of final essays <i>Gratitude</i>.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> Hayes has been a visiting scholar at the American Academy in Rome, the recipient of a Leon Levy Foundation grant, and a Resident Writer at Blue Mountain Center. He has also served as a guest lecturer at Stanford, NYU, UCSF, University of Virginia, and the New York Academy of Medicine.One<br><br> On the first day of class, i am mistaken for a teaching<br><br> assistant six times, which, on the one hand, simply tells me I&#x2019;m old&#x2014; a good twenty years older than the average student&#x2014;but, on the other hand, seems to imply that I look as if I belong. Choosing the glass half full, I smile through each mistaken identity.<br><br> The class size is 120 (150 if you count the cadavers). We had been warned that some students are overwhelmed by the first sight of the dead bodies. And sure enough, some students clearly are. But I am more freaked out by the woman in the gas mask. What does she know that the rest of us don&#x2019;t?<br><br> &#x201c;Class? Hello?&#x201d; comes a disembodied voice, tinnily amplified. This is Sexton Sutherland, one of the three professors, although I cannot see him for the crowd. &#x201c;Before we get started, some housekeeping rules . . .&#x201d;<br><br> The first thing he mentions is the color-coded wastebaskets: red is for tissue (the human type) and white is for regular garbage, and, please, please don&#x2019;t mix them up. Likewise with the sinks: use only the stainless steel for this and the porcelain for that, though I cannot catch the specifics for all the rustling. The mention of first- aid protocol finally brings the room to complete silence. And when Dr. Sutherland directs everyone&#x2019;s attention to the emergency biohazard showers in each corner of the lab, I find a sea of eyes sweeping over me, as I happen to be standing right next to one of them. Towel, anyone?<br><br> &#x201c;Finally, just some basic etiquette for the weeks to come: No eating your lunch in here.&#x201d; This elicits a collective ewwwww. &#x201c;No music. Please don&#x2019;t take any pictures. And try to keep your voices down. Laughter&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Dr. Sutherland adds. &#x201c;We love laughter in the lab&#x2014; it&#x2019;s a great way to release emotions. But not at the expense of the wonderful people who&#x2019;ve donated their bodies to our program.&#x201d; He lets that sink in for a moment. &#x201c;Okay, let&#x2019;s get going.&#x201d;<br><br> A class orientation had been held the day before in a lecture hall downstairs. Afterward, we were invited to check out the lab and, as Dr. Sutherland had said in a masterful sweep of understatement, &#x201c;to get comfortable with &#x2018;the surroundings,&#x2019; &#x201d; by which he meant the reclining dead. About half the class had made the trip up to the thirteenth floor, myself included. I was anxious to put glimpsing the cadavers for the first time behind me. And I am glad I did.<br><br> If that was the orientation, however, this is more like disorientation. I am not sure what to do or where to go exactly, so I grab the crisp new scrubs from my gym bag, pull them over my head, and join the large group being led by Dana Rohde, interim director of the anatomy course for the University of California&#x2013;San Francisco School of Pharmacy, whom I had met earlier. Using one cadaver as a demo model, she gives a brief overview of the afternoon&#x2019;s assignment; pauses to explain how to put a fresh blade onto a scalpel; does a quick scan to see that we are all wearing the mandatory rubber gloves; and adds finally, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be back to see how you&#x2019;re doing in half an hour.&#x201d; Dr. Rohde then stands there for a moment, wearing the look of a swimming instructor who finds her class still standing on the deck of the pool: Why aren&#x2019;t you wet yet?<br><br> Six of us arrange ourselves around cadaver number 4, but rather than looking at the naked female body lying before us, we all stare at one another.<br><br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t dissected anything since high school biology,&#x201d; one of the three women admits, breaking the ice. &#x201c;And that was a frog.&#x201d;<br><br> This seems like the right moment to make an admission of my own: &#x201c;I should tell you, I am not a student here. Dr. Rohde gave me permission to come to your lectures and labs. I&#x2019;m just going to be an observer.&#x201d;<br><br> All but one of them look as though they would pay to change places with me. Gergen, the exception, a tall, husky, hairy guy who says he has never dissected anything in his life, cheerfully volunteers to begin the dissection. Now, technically, it will be Gergen&#x2019;s first cut, but not this body&#x2019;s. Like all the cadavers used in this ten-week class in gross anatomy, it was worked on during a previous course. Instead of fresh bodies like those routinely autopsied on CSI&#x2014;blue- lipped and gray but still lifelike&#x2014;these are closer to something from a Discovery Channel special. The cadavers are shrunken like unwrapped Egyptian mummies. The skin, where still intact, is tan and leathery, and the exposed inner flesh is as dark and dried as beef jerky. The heads, hands, and feet are wrapped in strips of gauze, which gives the impression that they had been badly burned. As Dr. Sutherland explained during the orientation, the gauze serves two functions: it helps preserve the delicate parts for a longer period, and it also protects us, in a sense.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s usually most impactful to see the hands or the face,&#x201d; he had said, treading carefully with his words, &#x201c;because that&#x2019;s really what represents a person&#x2019;s identity.&#x201d; When dissecting other parts, one quickly learns to dissociate, but this is much harder when you see the eyes or the mouth. Emotions can come up unexpectedly, he then added. &#x201c;Sometimes, you&#x2019;ll be dissecting away&#x2014;maybe you&#x2019;re halfway through the course&#x2014;and then you&#x2019;ll remove a piece of gauze and there&#x2019;s a tattoo and you just stop cold. Or maybe you see nail polish.&#x201d; Any individualizing mark is a stark reminder that this is not just a body but somebody. As Dr. Sutherland had explained, this is one reason why the first dissection is in a relatively neutral location, the thorax, otherwise known as the chest.<br><br> Though I am the sole spectator here today, I take comfort in knowing I am well represented in history. Human dissection has been a riveting spectacle for centuries, and the curious, whether by invitation or paid ticket, have long pressed into crowded rooms, craning necks and breathing through perfumed handkerchiefs, to witness that first ghastly slice, then the next, and the next. In Europe, the need to create a space conducive to teaching, learning, and observing resulted in the Western world&#x2019;s first &#x201c;anatomical theater,&#x201d; built in Italy in 1594 at the University of Padua. A steeply raked amphitheater that accommodated three hundred, it became the model for other facilities that sprang up at competing schools, including the College of Physicians in London. Always at the center was the dissecting table, with the first circle of spectators barely a blood spurt removed. At UCSF, I and my fellow novice anatomists stand not in a theater but in a no-frills lab. In order to get the best view of what is being dissected at our table, I have to perch on the rungs of a metal stool.<br><br> Our cadaver, who in life probably stood no more than five foot two, does not bear the classic &#x201c;Y&#x201d; incision of an autopsy (shoulders to sternum, then straight down the abdomen to the pubis). Instead, a kind of double doorway was incised in her chest: the skin cut across the collarbones as well as beneath the ribs&#x2014;roughly marking the top and bottom of the thorax&#x2014;and then sliced down the middle. Before making a new incision, we need to &#x201c;unpack&#x201d; the previous work. As Laura reads instructions from the lab guide, Gergen folds back the two large panels of skin, then grasps the edges of the underlying breastplate, a solid shield of ribs and muscles that had been precut with a surgical saw. Gergen lifts, and a fresh wave of fumes escapes from the cadaver, making all of us flinch.<br><br> Peering down, I can see why the thorax was once known as the &#x201c;pantry&#x201d; of the body. It is a deep, squarish cavity packed full of various objects, one of which Gergen must now remove: a lung. He slips his left hand into the cavity and feels for &#x201c;the root of the lung,&#x201d; a short, fat tube that is not at the bottom of the lung, as one might imagine a root should be, but toward the top, connecting it to the windpipe. &#x201c;Now what?&#x201d; Gergen asks.<br><br> Laura, who is as small and slim as Gergen is large, scrambles to find the next instruction. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see here&#x2014;&#x2018;Cut through the root of the lung superiorly and continue inferiorly through the pulmonary ligament.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Translation?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Top to bottom&#x2014;slice it off&#x2014;I think.&#x201d;<br><br> Although Gergen does the actual cutting, the rest of us, in spirit at least, help him hold the scalpel steady: Laura, Amy, Miriam, and Massoud are the fingers folded in around him, and I, opposite them, am the thumb. Gergen then steps back, indicating to Laura that she may do the honors. Biting her lower lip, she reaches into the thoracic cavity and, after a little tugging, frees the right lung. The size of a wadded-up T-shirt, it looks like a wet mound of gray taffeta. All six of us wear identical triumphant smiles, as if we have delivered a baby.</p><h2>Three Complete 87th Precinct Novels: Tricks, Ice, 8 Black Horses</h2><p>Three fast-moving, best-selling police thrillers--Tricks, Ice, and 8 Black Horses--from among the more than thirty in his career, explain the unfailing popularity of this best-selling author.</p><p></p><h2>Enameling (New Crafts)</h2><p>This elegant and informative edition to the series illustrates the remarkable work being produced by today&#39;s enamellists using time-honored methods. 25 beautiful projects accompanied by over 300 full-color photographs are shown in simple, step-by-step sequences, including delicate floral inspired earrings and charming buttons for a sweater.

But not before a series of tragedies ensues that convince Junior that someone or something named Bartholomew is out to exact vengeance for that crime and the series of other murders that follow.<p> Bartholomew's own troubles begin with his birth, which transpires moments after his father is killed in a traffic accident as he is taking his wife to the hospital, and continue with the loss of his eyes at the tender age of 3. Young Bartholomew has visionary gifts, though to his mother, a nice lady who's renowned for her pie-making abilities as well as her sweetly innocent nature, he's just a particularly smart kid who can read and write before his second birthday. Eventually, Bartholomew regains his sight, Junior Cain gets his comeuppance, and fate conspires to bring love into the Pie Lady's life, reward the faithful, and put a happy ending on this genre-bending tale.

Born in London in 1908 and educated at Eton and Sandhurst, he became the Reuters Moscow correspondent in 1929. In the spring of 1939, Fleming went back to Moscow as a special correspondent for the <b>London Times</b>. In June of that same year, he joined Naval Intelligence and served throughout World War II, finally earning the rank of Commander, RNVSR (Sp.). Much of the James Bond material was drawn directly from Fleming's experiences as an intelligence officer. Later, Fleming became a consultant on foreign affairs for the <b>London Sunday Times</b>, by which time he had become far better known as the creator of James Bond.</p><p><b>1. THE RED CARPET</b></p> <p>There are moments of great luxury in the life of a secret agent. There are assignments on which he is required to act the part of a very rich man; occasions when he takes refuge in good living to efface the memory of danger and the shadow of death; and times when, as was now the case, he is a guest in the territory of an allied Secret Service.</p> <p>From the moment the BOAC Stratocruiser taxied up to the International Air Terminal at Idlewild, James Bond was treated like royalty.</p> <p>When he left the aircraft with the other passengers he had resigned himself to the notorious purgatory of the US Health, Immigration and Customs machinery. At least an hour, he thought, of overheated, drab-green rooms smelling of last year's air and stale sweat and guilt and the fear that hangs round all frontiers, fear of those closed doors marked PRIVATE that hide the careful men, the files, the teleprinters chattering urgently to Washington, to the Bureau of Narcotics, Counter Espionage, the Treasury, the FBI.</p> <p>As he walked across the tarmac in the bitter January wind he saw his own name going over the network: BOND, JAMES. BRITISH DIPLOMATIC PASSPORT 0094567, the short wait and the replies coming back on the different machines: NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE, NEGATIVE. And then, from the FBI: POSITIVE AWAIT CHECK. There would be some hasty traffic on the FBI circuit with the Central Intelligence Agency and then: FBI TO IDLEWILD: BOND OKAY OKAY, and the bland official out front would hand him back his passport with a 'Hope you enjoy your stay, Mr Bond.'</p> <p>Bond shrugged his shoulders and followed the other passengers through the wire fence towards the door marked US HEALTH SERVICE.</p> <p>In his case it was only a boring routine, of course, but he disliked the idea of his dossier being in the possession of any foreign power. Anonymity was the chief tool of his trade. Every thread of his real identity that went on record in any file diminished his value and, ultimately, was a threat to his life. Here in America, where they knew all about him, he felt like a negro whose shadow has been stolen by the witch-doctor. A vital part of himself was in pawn, in the hands of others. Friends, of course, in this instance, but still . . .</p> <p>'Mr Bond?'</p> <p>A pleasant-looking nondescript man in plain clothes had stepped forward from the shadow of the Health Service building.</p> <p>'My name's Halloran. Pleased to meet you!'</p> <p>They shook hands.</p> <p>'Hope you had a pleasant trip. Would you follow me, please?'</p> <p>He turned to the officer of the Airport police on guard at the door.</p> <p>'Okay, Sergeant.' 'Okay, Mr Halloran. Be seeing you.'</p> <p>The other passengers had passed inside. Halloran turned to the left, away from the building. Another policeman held open a small gate in the high boundary fence.</p> <p>'Bye, Mr Halloran.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Bye, Officer. Thanks.'</p> <p>Directly outside a black Buick waited, its engine sighing quietly. They climbed in. Bond's two light suitcases were in front next to the driver. Bond couldn't imagine how they had been extracted so quickly from the mound of passengers' luggage he had seen only minutes before being trolleyed over to Customs.</p> <p>'Okay, Grady. Let's go.'</p> <p>Bond sank back luxuriously as the big limousine surged forward, slipping quickly into top through the Dynaflow gears.</p> <p>He turned to Halloran.</p> <p>'Well, that's certainly one of the reddest carpets I've ever seen. I expected to be at least an hour getting through Immigration. Who laid it on? I'm not used to VIP treatment. Anyway, thanks very much for your part in it all.'</p> <p>'You're very welcome, Mr Bond.' Halloran smiled and offered him a cigarette from a fresh pack of Luckies. 'We want to make your stay comfortable. Anything you want, just say so and it's yours. You've got some good friends in Washington. I don't myself know why you're here but it seems the authorities are keen that you should be a privileged guest of the Government. It's my job to see you get to your hotel as quickly and as comfortably as possible and then I'll hand over and be on my way. May I have your passport a moment, please.'</p> <p>Bond gave it to him. Halloran opened a briefcase on the seat beside him and took out a heavy metal stamp. He turned the pages of Bond's passport until he came to the US Visa, stamped it, scribbled his signature over the dark blue circle of the Department of Justice cypher and gave it back to him. Then he took out his pocket-book and extracted a thick white envelope which he gave to Bond.</p> <p>'There's a thousand dollars in there, Mr Bond.' He held up his hand as Bond started to speak. 'And it's Communist money we took in the Schmidt-Kinaski haul. We're using it back at them and you are asked to co-operate and spend this in any way you like on your present assignment. I am advised that it will be considered a very unfriendly act if you refuse. Let's please say no more about it and,' he added, as Bond continued to hold the envelope dubiously in his hand, 'I am also to say that the disposal of this money through your hands has the knowledge and approval of your own Chief.'</p> <p>Bond eyed him narrowly and then grinned. He put the envelope away in his notecase.</p> <p>'All right,' he said. 'And thanks. I'll try and spend it where it does most harm. I'm glad to have some working capital. It's certainly good to know it's been provided by the opposition.'</p> <p>'Fine,' said Halloran; 'and now, if you'll forgive me, I'll just write up my notes for the report I'll have to put in. Have to remember to get a letter of thanks sent to Immigration and Customs and so forth for their co-operation. Routine.'</p> <p>'Go ahead,' said Bond. He was glad to keep silent and gaze out at his first sight of America since the war. It was no waste of time to start picking up the American idiom again: the advertisements, the new car models and the prices of second-hand ones in the used-car lots; the exotic pungency of the road signs: SOFT SHOULDERS - SHARP CURVES - SQUEEZE AHEAD - SLIPPERY WHEN WET; the standard of driving; the number of women at the wheel, their menfolk docilely beside them; the men's clothes; the way the women were doing their hair; the Civil Defence warnings: IN CASE OF ENEMY ATTACK - KEEP MOVING - GET OFF BRIDGE; the thick rash of television aerials and the impact of TV on hoardings and shop windows; the occasional helicopter; the public appeals for cancer and polio funds: THE MARCH OF DIMES - all the small, fleeting impressions that were as important to his trade as are broken bark and bent twigs to the trapper in the jungle.</p> <p>The driver chose the Triborough Bridge and they soared across the breath-taking span into the heart of uptown Manhattan, the beautiful prospect of New York hastening towards them until they were down amongst the hooting, teeming, petrol-smelling roots of the stressed-concrete jungle.</p> <p>Bond turned to his companion.</p> <p>'I hate to say it,' he said, 'but this must be the fattest atomic-bomb target on the whole face of the globe.'</p> <p>'Nothing to touch it,' agreed Halloran. 'Keeps me awake nights thinking what would happen.'</p> <p>They drew up at the best hotel in New York, the St Regis, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th Street. A saturnine middle-aged man in a dark blue overcoat and black homburg came forward behind the commissionaire. On the sidewalk, Halloran introduced him.</p> <p>'Mr Bond, meet Captain Dexter.' He was deferential. 'Can I pass him along to you now, Captain?'</p> <p>'Sure, sure. Just have his bags sent up. Room 2100. Top floor. I'll go ahead with Mr Bond and see he has everything he wants.'</p> <p>Bond turned to say good-bye to Halloran and thank him. For a moment Halloran had his back to him as he said something about Bond's luggage to the commissionaire. Bond looked past him across 55th Street. His eyes narrowed. A black sedan, a Chevrolet, was pulling sharply out into the thick traffic, right in front of a Checker cab that braked hard, its driver banging his fist down on the horn and holding it there. The sedan kept going, just caught the tail of the green light, and disappeared north up Fifth Avenue.</p> <p>It was a smart, decisive bit of driving, but what startled Bond was that it had been a negress at the wheel, a fine-looking negress in a black chauffeur's uniform, and through the rear window he had caught a glimpse of the single passenger - a huge grey-black face which had turned slowly towards him and looked directly back at him, Bond was sure of it, as the car accelerated towards the Avenue.</p> <p>Bond shook Halloran by the hand. Dexter touched his elbow impatiently.</p> <p>'We'll go straight in and through the lobby to the elevators. Half-right across the lobby. And would you please keep your hat on, Mr Bond.'</p> <p>As Bond followed Dexter up the steps into the hotel he reflected that it was almost certainly too late for these precautions. Hardly anywhere in the world will you find a negress driving a car. A negress acting as a chauffeur is still more extraordinary. Barely conceivable even in Harlem, but that was certainly where the car was from.</p> <p>And the giant shape in the back seat? That grey-black face? Mister Big?</p> <p>'Hm,' said Bond to himself as he followed the slim back of Captain Dexter into the elevator.</p> <p>The elevator slowed up for the twenty-first floor.</p> <p>'We've got a little surprise ready for you, Mr Bond,' said Captain Dexter, without, Bond thought, much enthusiasm.</p> <p>They walked down the corridor to the corner room.</p> <p>The wind sighed outside the passage windows and Bond had a fleeting view of the tops of other skyscrapers and, beyond, the stark fingers of the trees in Central Park. He felt far out of touch with the ground and for a moment a strange feeling of loneliness and empty space gripped his heart.</p> <p>Dexter unlocked the door of No. 2100 and shut it behind them. They were in a small lighted lobby. They left their hats and coats on a chair and Dexter opened the door in front of...</p></p><h2>The Start Here Diet: Three Simple Steps That Helped Me Transition from Fat to Slim . . . for Life</h2><p>With her <i>Eat-Clean Diet, </i>Tosca Reno went from being overwhelmed and overweight to modeling a bikini, but her seventy-pound weight loss and body transformation didn&#x2019;t happen overnight; even Tosca needed a simple approach, a place to begin.

Not on purpose. Not because we want to mislead others. But because we are in such pain, or feel so uncomfortable with how we look or how we feel, that we hide. We hide from our families, our friends, our doctors, our co-�workers. We hide from ourselves. We hide because we feel ashamed. We tell everyone that we feel fine because how could we possibly admit that we are not?<br><br>For years, I lived my life in hiding, and coming out of hiding took some painful reckoning. When others asked how I was doing, I would reply in a defensive tone, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine!&#x201d; The message I clearly sent with that response was &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t dig any deeper. Leave me alone.&#x201d;<br><br>When I was seventy-�five pounds overweight, I was heavy emotionally as well as physically. I gained the weight because I was out of touch with my inner needs and voice; remaining heavy was a way to continue hiding. Admitting and recognizing the power of that inner place is where my journey to permanent weight loss and health began. And it will be the same for you. Not the same story, but the same reaching inward to the place where you&#x2019;ve been hiding.<br><br>To understand my weight loss journey you need to also understand what else I had to lose&#x2014;�small step by small step&#x2014;�before I could shed pounds and find my true self.<br><br>I grew up in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, with three siblings, one sister and two brothers. We had a happy home and my parents were loving and supportive. My dad was resourceful, reliable, and sturdy. But it was my mom who was in charge of things. She was strict and she set high standards for me and my siblings; she wanted the best for us all and pushed us to achieve.<br><br>I was always a strong-�willed young girl. I loved the challenge of competition. I was an athlete&#x2014;�I ran, swam, and played soccer. I loved horses. I was always on the move, rarely looking behind me as I forged ahead into my next new adventure. Always in a rush, I sometimes didn&#x2019;t look ahead either. I had more than a few run-�ins with telephone wires and bushes and tree roots!<br><br>At university I studied science. I also fell in love hard and fast when I was just twenty years old. Since my then-�love was a couple of years ahead of me academically, I interrupted my studies when he graduated and together we went out west. I believed in his dreams for our success and for our future together. We were married when I was twenty-�three&#x2014;�not unusually young for the time, but definitely an age when I was only just beginning to understand myself.<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t question giving up further education for my husband&#x2019;s career: it seemed natural, something I could do to show him the depth of my love and commitment. Besides, didn&#x2019;t I have the rest of my life to figure out what I wanted to do?<br><br>But very early into my marriage, my connection to myself began to disappear. I cannot tell you about one specific moment, or even one particular event that triggered my separation from myself. It was a slow build. But day by day, month by month, I began to lose a sense of my own importance. It probably began with the very simple act of giving up what had been important to me&#x2014;�studying science&#x2014;�for someone else&#x2019;s dream.<br><br>Even as I was thrilled to have children, I think I really let go of the real Tosca when I became a mother. Like many women (of all ages), I jumped into parenthood and all its responsibilities and quickly became absorbed in making other people happy. What I can see now is that when I focused so completely on caring for my kids, I stopped knowing how to care for myself. But that wasn&#x2019;t the only reason I began hiding.<br><br>Early in my marriage, we moved a lot for my husband&#x2019;s job. The moves were necessary for his career, but they were also disruptive and I was more or less solely responsible for the logistics of each move and for helping the kids adjust each time. I loved my husband; the heavy lifting was a way of showing my support. But each move was stressful and each one took a lot out of me. It should have been goodwill that was building in our partnership, but instead there was mounting tension, and I felt I had to walk on eggshells. A lot of the time, especially at home, I felt nervous and vulnerable. This emotional environment made me withdraw from myself even more. It didn&#x2019;t feel safe to simply be me. Even now as I describe it to you, the reader, I realize I was then and am still afraid to admit that my relationship was transitioning from love to routine, and ultimately to something very different from love; it was abuse.<br><br>When I was twenty-�six, I gave birth to our third beautiful daughter. Soon thereafter, we moved yet again, the seventh time in ten years. Again, I felt enormous joy bringing forth this new life into the world. But I was beginning to realize that there was a darkness creeping in and around me. I was busy, busy, busy and yet never made time for myself. My movements kept me out of my head and out of my heart. I scurried around for others. I wanted to think everything was perfect. I began to tell myself, &#x201c;Everything is fine.&#x201d; &#x201c;You should be grateful.&#x201d; But somewhere deep inside me I knew these words were just not true. And on the surface life was indeed grand. I loved our house, our great community, our pretty little suburban neighborhood. I got wonderfully lost in being a mom. I loved being with my girls and teaching them about school, life, and themselves. Isn&#x2019;t this what I needed to make my life meaningful, my heart feel safe and purposeful?<br><br>The surface never tells the whole story. In reality, with each passing day, month, and year, I was becoming less happy, less relaxed, more stressed, and more sad. I found myself relying on destructive ways of covering my anxiety and dulling my own yearnings. &#x201c;Time for myself&#x201d; was time spent eating. I had a warped sense of what it meant to indulge my own needs!<br><br>My bad habits consumed me. Some of these habits may even seem familiar to you. I stayed up late after everyone went to bed, made myself comfortable on the living room sofa, and lost myself in a quart of ice cream or a jar of peanut butter. Swallowing one spoonful after another, I no longer tasted the food or felt the pleasure of its sweetness. Rather, I shoveled in food to obliterate my own feelings of sadness. My husband and I had drifted far apart&#x2014;�he busy with work and I busy managing the house and family to a self-�imposed perfection. I berated myself if the house was messy or if there were things left undone at the end of a busy day. These late night feed-�fests were a way of battling back the feeling that I was a loser. I was desperate to block out the constant, gnawing fear that something was terribly wrong with me, with my life. One of the most basic human needs, according to Tony Robbins, master life coach, is the need to feel significant. Caring for everyone else was meaningful work and had my marriage been happy, I might have felt differently, but all I knew then is that the care and feeding of other souls didn&#x2019;t satisfy my own soul&#x2019;s need for significance.<br><br>When I got married, I weighed about 127 pounds&#x2014;�thin for a woman of my height (5'8"). But ten years later, the number on the scale had reached two hundred and four pounds. I was a bloated and obscured version of my former self.<br><br>At two hundred plus pounds, I avoided mirrors and cameras. I hid myself in big, bulky clothes. Everything about my body made me feel awkward, ill at ease, not good enough. The photo on this book is one of the only ones I have of myself at that time&#x2014;�it&#x2019;s not that I threw them all away, but rather that I rarely stepped out from behind the camera to allow myself to be photographed! I didn&#x2019;t want to document my unhappy weight. I didn&#x2019;t want to document my sad truth.<br><br>In addition to simply gaining weight, I also started to be physically unwell. On several occasions I even passed out. This was hypoglycemia at work&#x2014;�my organs were beginning to complain about my poor diet. My blood sugar would soar, then plummet, taking its toll on my entire body. I was often sweaty, clammy, and dizzy. I sometimes had heart palpitations&#x2014;�an irregular heartbeat that caused a tightness in my chest. This really scared me because my father had suffered from heart disease all his life, and ultimately the disease took him from this world. I didn&#x2019;t want the same fate for me and my kids.<br><br>As perhaps you know, food has a terrible way of being both a problem and a solution. With each passing day, month, and year, I continued to use food to calm me but also to squelch my dreams and block out my thoughts of my future. The more I ate, the more I felt further diminished, unworthy, and dependent. I had trouble even remembering who I had been as a girl and young woman before I married. Some days, I would quickly glance at photos from my childhood. The images staring back at me of the smiling, strong, confident girl had nothing to do with who I had become. Yet most troubling of all was that I couldn&#x2019;t figure out how to connect the dots: I knew I ate too much, but how, really, had I become this person staring back at me in the mirror?<br><br>Not surprisingly, I was on edge all the time, and I took even a passing comment about my weight as a deep criticism about me as a person. I saw disapproval in other&#x2019;s eyes. And I heard a nasty voice in my ear: &#x201c;You look fat today.&#x201d; &#x201c;Why are you wearing that blouse?&#x201d; &#x201c;Those jeans don&#x2019;t exactly flatter you.&#x201d; &#x201c;Are you crazy or something?&#x201d;<br><br>How had I become this sad, overweight, powerless woman? And what was I doing to myself? Where was my belief in my own power?<br><br>The bigger I got on the outside, the more I retreated into my litany of self-�criticism. I resisted listening to a deep part of me who wanted that frank inner conversation&#x2014;�about my marriage, about my future, about what I wanted to do with the rest of my time on Earth. I was depressed, lonely, and powerless to seek help. In truth I didn&#x2019;t know where to look. I needed this book all those years ago but there wasn&#x2019;t anything like it at the time of my crisis.<br><br>This feeling of paralysis kept me stuck in my destructive, repetitive behaviors. I didn&#x2019;t realize these negative patterns were part of the prison I was building around myself. There were rare occasions when I allowed myself to peek out and have fun, usually with my children, but most of the time I was introverted and quiet.<br><br>I focused on the girls, wanting only to keep them safe and happy, and their busy lives provided good cover. But was this real? Was this even good for the girls if it was so wrong, so bad, for me?<br><br>Of course, children always see more than you want them to&#x2014;�they knew I was unhappy. They knew something was not right in the house. Because I was not taking care of myself, because I was eating fatty, sugary foods that zapped my energy, I was compounding an already bad situation.<br><br>I am certain many of you can relate to that experience: our families are our priority, but it&#x2019;s a slippery slope from taking care of others to neglecting ourselves. It becomes&#x2014;�without our even realizing it&#x2014;�somehow more comfortable to put the needs of others before our own. And to be sure, this &#x201c;giving up&#x201d; and giving so much of ourselves feels good&#x2014;�it&#x2019;s one way we can show our love for others. But of course there are many ways to show our love for others that don&#x2019;t compromise our own needs and hopes and dreams. I didn&#x2019;t realize that then at all. In a way, I think that I shifted into sacrifice mode so that I could mask my own fears of being who I was. But sacrifice comes at a price, and mine was to become emotionally, physically, and spiritually depleted.<br><br>Today of course, I know that true beauty and happiness do not come from the outer appearance so much as from what is radiating from deep inside. But at this time in my life, I had not yet discovered this clear truth. It&#x2019;s curious to me how what you put out in the universe is what you receive. When I was younger, in my twenties and thirties, I was nothing but an envelope of negativity, and that is exactly what I got back. It did not occur to me to operate from love and gratitude. I didn&#x2019;t know where to look for positive support or a reality check; I didn&#x2019;t even realize that I needed a reality check because I was completely convinced that I knew where I stood and that I was a bad person for getting to that place. I was convinced that I was worth nothing. The more I internalized this thinking, the worse I allowed others to treat me. It was a vicious cycle. I stayed bound in this kind of thinking for years, actually allowing others to treat me badly, further tightening the chains around my spirit. Soon, though, I was going to take a profoundly simple step: I was going to look inside myself and gather my courage to believe that I did matter. I was about to dive inward.<br><br>But in those early days, the only voice I heard was small and squeaky, telling me not to take up so much space. Hide, the little voice told me. I suppose if I were really in a prison I would curl up in a ball in the farthest corner and keep myself from view. The dominant feeling I was experiencing was shame. I was ashamed at myself for being a failure, fat, insignificant, and worthless. This was not the way I was raised or the person I had expected to be. I had allowed myself and others to destroy my purpose.<br><br>Deep down, I knew something was wrong with my life. If I had had the courage to be honest with myself at the time, I would have admitted that what was wrong was my marriage: it had soured beyond repair. My husband and I had drifted worlds apart and weren&#x2019;t supportive or communicative with each other. I was not happy and I did not feel respected, truly loved, or cared for. I felt uneasy in my own home, too vulnerable to relax and be myself. But even as I am now sure that my husband was as much to blame as me, I still thought I was the one in the wrong. I doubted my own instincts: Are things really that bad? Maybe I am just holding myself to impossible standards. Don&#x2019;t all women feel this way about marriage after a while?<br><br>I would try to justify my feelings, my fear of change, always arriving at the same conclusion: You don&#x2019;t have what it takes to live a different kind of life. You owe it to your family to try harder and stay with them.<br><br>So I soldiered on, and kept on eating in a silent battle with myself.<br><br>Food was the only personal joy I had. Food had become my medicine, my best friend, my only safe, reliable source of comfort. After all my work for the day was done, after everyone else was in bed, I retreated to the living room sofa. I might turn on the television; sometimes I read magazines and dreamed about faraway places that looked exotic or romantic. But then I closed the cover and settled in to eat my quart of ice cream, hunk of cheese, or spoonfuls of peanut butter again and again&#x2014;�and, often, all of them together.<br><br>Sometimes I was scared I would be caught eating, and I actually hid in the closet for fear that my husband would angrily criticize my eating and my weight. He had a temper and I was often the target for it. He thought my overeating was a deep flaw and a sign of weakness, and I believed he was right about me. I felt ugly, unsexy, and worthless. He didn&#x2019;t contradict me or help me think otherwise. My late-�night trysts with food had become one of the few sources of pleasure in a life that was becoming increasingly unsafe. Under cover of darkness, I thought no one would notice what was becoming of me.<br><br>It&#x2019;s not like I didn&#x2019;t try to get out of this mess of an existence. I didn&#x2019;t try to leave the marr...</p><h2>Domestic Violence: Poems</h2><p><p><strong>A celebrated collection from "one of the finest and boldest poets of the last half century" (<em>Poetry Review</em>).</strong></p> These are poems about the charged spaces in which people live, about the interiors where seductions, quarrels, memories, and griefs occur. A marriage is a window for outward violence; a painted cup becomes a theater for a long love; in an ordinary room a mythic violation takes place.</p><p>Eavan Boland is the author of more than a dozen volumes of poetry and nonfiction. A professor and the director of the creative writing program at Stanford University, she is the winner of a Lannan Foundation Award. She lives in Stanford, California, and Dublin, Ireland.Vivid and passionate, if at times repetitive, Boland's 10th book of verse returns to familiar subjects: Irish landscapes, seascapes and townscapes, erotic passion and persistent anger between men and women, households that carry the weight of an unjust history, and Boland's own hopes to make that history clear. Boland (<i>Against Love Poetry</i>) pursues, in fierce, accessible free verse her sense that the personal is political. She also depicts a pathos in nature, using attractive lyrical symbols: "the red-billed bird/ with swept-back wings always trying to/ arrive safely on the inch or so of cotton it/ might have occupied." Elsewhere she describes the uneasiness of love: "nothing is ever entirely/ right in the lives of those who love each other." Though all her books invoke her Irish roots, this one is more self-consciously Irish than most: several poems address, or describe, Irish art, such as James Melton's 1765 engraving of a Dublin mansion. Boland links herself to a national past, even as she interrogates it on feminist and other grounds, and even as she turns to familial subjects: to her own memory, to advancing age, to questions any mother might ask, such as how to know "what I have to leave behind, to give my daughters." <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Neiman's art transcends all class distinctions to capture the kaleidoscopic social scene. We also catch an intimate glimpse of the artist at work and see him sketching his subjects 'on the spot.'<br><br>This book provides answers to intriguing questions about LeRoy Neiman such as: where does he get his inspiration? How does he view his potential subjects? What goes on in his mind during the actual creative process? <br><br>Among contemporary artists, no other eye has been so devoted to recording the pleasures and vices of its own age. He checks out the fleeting spectacle of the social scene. He is a keen analyst of our unconscious fears and petty vanities. His target is the masks we wear in public, the convenient image we project in our dealings with others. His style can accommodate a variety of subjects: haute cuisine in France's top restaurants, insights into the aristocratic manners of the highborn, the meaning of 'Blacks blacking it,' or the look and feel of a championship prizefight. LeRoy Neiman - the go-go artist in Neimanland. He occupies a unique superstar position in pop culture wile also standing alone... an original in the art community. <br><br>This is the first time that a cross section of Neiman's work has been gathered together between two covers. The meaning behind Neiman's art is given verbal and visual expression; we hear the artist's thoughts on his own paintings.

Bobbi Finley is an award-winning quilter whose work has been featured in numerous exhibitions.It looked like something I've been thinking about since seeing these curtains on the Anthropologie website. I have been thinking about making them since the summer but, just never had the energy. My next thought was to make a quilt using the same idea because I do not have good warm blankets. Well, I only have one. When I saw the Anthropologie curtain I knew immediately where the motifs came from. I have two books with them inside. The Tile Quilt Revival book took my idea to another thought because it suggests drawing a picture, cutting out the different shapes and leaving space between them. C&amp;T has it so you can see a preview of the book. If you are in the market for a new reference book I recommend this book. I like to work with large pieces which is why the Anthropologie curtain appealed to me. I put it all together and came up with this. (Brandy Wine, 12/5/09 <i>12/5/09</i>)<br><br>Jones and Finley are bringing back an old technique in Tile Quilt Revival. Applique is placed, leaving margins between the pieces like tile grout or stained glass. Think needle-turn applique or simple fusing. Lots of potential here. (. <i>American Quilt Retailer, January 1, 2010</i>)<br><br>These beautiful pieces have a stained-glass look, but lighter and airier. Construction-wise, instead of leading applied over the raw edges of the shapes, these shapes are finished with turned edges, and the background is left exposed to create the spaces between shapes. Tile Quilt Revival: Reinventing a Forgotten Form is Carol and Bobbi's fascinating, educational, and inviting book that reintroduces this unique and somewhat obscure form of applique quilt. Tile quilts are explained this way: Traditional tile quilts. are constructed with small pieces of cotton fabric appliqued in a random manner to a white background, leaving a narrow space between the pieces; this white space serves as the grout between the tiles or mortar between the pavers or stones. The books starts out with a brief history of tile quilts, with great photos showing examples from the past. Then comes a section on how to make a tile quilt, reinterpreted for today. When I read the following, the heavens opened up and I heard the heavenly choir! The tile quilt technique, with its large and simple shapes, creates an ideal showcase for bold, contemporary fabrics. Interesting, large-scale prints are will suited for the tile pieces. If you've ever found yourself admiring some of the daring prints now available but wondering how to use them, a tile quilt is an idea project for putting them to good use. Hallelujah! I have a tub of fabrics in my stash labeled Modern that has been. well. sitting there. Now my daring prints have a destiny! The techniques used in the book are so simple they're ingenious! No need to consider seam allowances, to reverse patterns, or to figure out where to place the pieces. Another really great thing about this book is that it has fantastic applique instructions. needle-turn by hand, turned-edge machine-applique and fusible machine applique too, all expertly explained and illustrated. (. <i>All About Applique, March 3, 2010</i>)<br><br>Tile Quilt Revival by by Carol Gilham Jones &amp; Bobbi Finley. I've always been drawn to murals made out of tiles and this quilt book is right there to satisfy my predeliction for them. This type of quilt was popular in the 19th Century. The ones in the book use contemporary fabrics to modernize this charming quilting tradition that I was not aware of. Oh, I've seen some quilts that look like mosaics, but these look more like tile when you browse the 6 projects they include. I look forward to making a tile quilt in the near future. If you've seen one or two, tell me about it. I'd like to learn more about these beauties.

That is exactly what happens when Professor Carnine walks into his office in this 12th addition to the series.<br><br>Milan recognizes Dr. Carnine's name, but can't remember from where until Dr. Carnine explains. His daughter's body was found under a local bridge. The police agreed that 30-year-old Ellen Carnine committed suicide, or in street parlance "did the dutch." However, Dr. Carnine cannot accept that answer and wants Milan to find out what could have driven his daughter, somewhat of a recluse, to take her own life? He is filled with guilt that maybe there was something about his daughter he should have known, that maybe there was a way he could have helped her. Reluctantly, Milan agrees to take the case knowing that the outcome will not be happy for anyone. <br><br>Milan finds that Ellen spent most of her time on the computer either working or on the Internet and that she was appreciated by her bosses, a pair of young Cleveland entrepreneurs who made movies. But interviews with her few friends lead him to see her as an independent person who got satisfaction from her work and had accepted the fact that she was seriously overweight and physically unattractive. <br><br>Digging further, Milan comes upon upsetting small clues that shout "murder" to him, and suspicions about what her employers were actually up to grow. His investigation begins to take a different, and eventually dangerous, direction until he uncovers the horrific truth behind Ellen's death. <br></p><p>Les Roberts, a native Chicagoan, lives in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

A few years back it was officially rechristened the Hope Memorial Bridge, after the father of local favorite son Bob Hope; the elder Hope worked as a stonemason during its construction. But no real Clevelander ever calls it that, just as New Yorkers still say &#x201c;Sixth Avenue&#x201d; instead of the newer &#x201c;Avenue of the Americas,&#x201d; even after fifty years.</p> <p>The bridge is less than a mile from my office on the west bank of the river in the industrial area known as the Flats. I wasn&#x2019;t anywhere near it, though, but home asleep when Ellen Carnine plunged one hundred and forty-some feet over the concrete balustrade, smashing her skull, breaking her neck and fracturing most of the other bones in her body when she landed.</p> <p>The coroner estimated that the time of death was around four o&#x2019;clock in the morning, but I didn&#x2019;t know about it until just before nine, when I was driving to work down Cedar Hill from my apartment in Cleveland Heights, sipping a go-cup of the last of my morning coffee and listening to the news and the laughs on the John Lanigan and Jimmy Malone Show on WMJI radio.</p> <p>I winced a little when newsman Chip Kullik read the report&#x2015;jumping off a bridge had to be one of the worst ways to go&#x2015;and felt sad for a moment that a woman had taken her own life, but after that I didn&#x2019;t give it much thought. Bad things happen to nice people every day, and while poet John Donne had a valid point when he wrote that each man&#x2019;s death diminishes us, the fact is that the death of a complete stranger doesn&#x2019;t diminish us very much. Practically speaking, we can&#x2019;t allow it to. We all have our own lives and our own concerns, and we couldn&#x2019;t even function if we went around feeling diminished every time somebody succumbs to old age or takes a notion to do a half-gainer off a bridge.</p> <p>Ellen Carnine died on a Tuesday. A cool Tuesday in spring, the first week in May. After a long and dreary winter the Midwest was struggling through its annual rebirth. Lawns and trees were greening again, and the early spring flowers that bordered the houses of suburban Shaker Heights and Lakewood and Rocky River were gaily proclaiming that the season was finally turning and we could at last be almost certain that the snows were gone for the duration.</p> <p>Of course in Cleveland, you never really know about snow, even in May.</p> <p>By the time the following week rolled around, the cool Tuesday had given way to a warm Monday, and I had switched from my wools and tweeds to a lightweight linen sports jacket over tan chinos and a dark blue shirt without a tie, and when I parked my car in front of the old warehouse-turned-office building that I had bought several years earlier I took a moment to stroll down to the riverbank and enjoy the view across the water to Tower City and Jacobs Field and the great gray hunchbacked whale that is Gund Arena, to suck some clean spring air into my cigarette smoke-cured lungs, and watch the flock of hungry gulls darken the bright blue sky with their wings as they dipped over the water looking for breakfast.</p> <p>Almost one hundred years ago this hairpin turn in the Cuyahoga River was christened Collision Bend, and while there hasn&#x2019;t been an aquatic fender-bender between two six-hundred-foot ore boats in some time, there is a certain romance in the name that appeals to me, perhaps because it sometimes seems we are all on collision courses in our lives, bumping into one another head-on or sideways or maybe just scraping each other&#x2019;s sides, acknowledging the dents and dings, and then moving along in spite of them.</p> <p>I finally went upstairs to my office. It&#x2019;s one very large room and one small storage and utility room that takes up half of the second floor, the other half being occupied by a surgical supply house who, along with me, endures the noise of the wrought-iron company that chuffs and clanks and clangs down on the first floor. It&#x2019;s a constant irritant, but for that view across the river to the city I would have even suffered listening to rap music all day.</p> <p>Well, maybe not rap music.</p> <p>Milan Security is my one-man operation, christened out of my own ego after my own first name. It&#x2019;s pronounced My-lan, by the way, and the only thing that kept me from giving my company my last name is that it&#x2019;s even harder to pronounce properly than Milan. Spelled J-A-C-O-V-I-C-H, pronounced Yock-o-vitch. And if someone is looking in the Yellow Pages for an industrial security specialist such as myself, they&#x2019;ll probably call the one whose name they feel more comfortable in saying aloud, even though many people manage to screw that up, too, giving it the old-world pronunciation, Mee-lahn, or saying it like the city in Italy, Mi-lahn.</p> <p>I set to work typing up a report commissioned by an insurance company that was trying to wriggle out from under a workman&#x2019;s-comp payoff. I had spent the better part of a month keeping an undercover watch on a fifty-two-year-old factory employee who had filed a huge claim for a work-related back injury; the insurers were hoping I&#x2019;d catch him playing tennis, running a 10K marathon, or dancing the lambada so they could deny him his benefits, but during my surveillance I&#x2019;d seen him do nothing more strenuous than limp painfully to and from his car on his way to his physical-therapy sessions.</p> <p>My clients were going to be annoyed with me, but I couldn&#x2019;t find fraud where there was none. So the insurance folks were going to wind up not only paying the workman&#x2019;s comp claim, but my fee as well.</p> <p>Too bad for my clients, but in a way it gave me a good feeling to know that the injured worker I&#x2019;d been surveilling wasn&#x2019;t trying to run a shitty on them. In my business when I find someone who is not crooked or corrupt or playing an angle, it restores my faith in the basic decency of the human animal.</p> <p>I had just about finished the report when a new client called and requested an appointment for that afternoon. Despite the urgency in his tone, he opted not to give me any details over the phone. That immediately made me suspicious, but most people who seek the services of investigators like me desire discretion and confidentiality, and I figured he could have been someplace where other people might overhear, or be paranoid enough to think his telephone was bugged. Either way, it would only cost half an hour of my time to listen to him and find out, and I could afford that, at least.</p> <p>He told me his name, which tinkled a very distant bell, and when I asked what firm he was with, he said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a private matter.&#x201d;</p> <p>That rang a louder bell, all right. A warning bell.</p> <p>I have a private investigator&#x2019;s license, which means that occasionally I am compelled to take on a job that has nothing to do with industrial security. I don&#x2019;t like those much; they tend to get sordid. Being my own boss, I am able to pick and choose my assignments, and I regularly turn down the ones that involve window-peeping on errant spouses and other such ugliness. If someone&#x2019;s marriage is imploding, I&#x2019;d just as soon it blew without any involvement on my part. But workman&#x2019;s-comp stakeouts and subcontracting security systems and vetting new employees for large corporations was for the most part pretty dry stuff, and I took on the private clients in between the more mundane assignments either as a favor to someone or simply to get my blood flowing a little faster.</p> <p>The name of my two-thirty appointment was maddeningly familiar, but I couldn&#x2019;t retrieve it from my subconscious. Sort of like a computer file document lost in cyberspace. And despite my owning and using a computer for the last few years, my knowledge and expertise is woefully inadequate. So I know about losing files.</p> <p>I saved my insurance report to my hard drive and printed out two copies, one for my client and one for myself, and went out to lunch. I sorely miss the convenient and honest steak sandwiches and deliciously greasy hash browns I used to eat regularly at Jim&#x2019;s Steak House, an old Cleveland landmark and a favorite hangout of mine, only a fifty-yard walk from the office. But it had closed down a few years earlier only to be reincarnated as a nightclub, and now I had to drive someplace every day to eat.</p> <p>On this particular day I chose a place on Old River Road on the Cuyahoga&#x2019;s east bank, and kept my mind occupied watching the railroad bridge go up and down to accommodate the river traffic heading out to the lake. There were quite a few pleasure craft on the water, which should have been surprising but wasn&#x2019;t. I guess if you can afford a forty-foot powerboat that sleeps six, you can afford to play with it on a Monday afternoon when the rest of the world is at work. Almost every one of the boats had a beautiful woman somewhere on board, dressed skimpily in warm-weather casual wear and usually waving to us landlubbers as they floated by, like the original Queen Elizabeth greeting the peasants from her carriage. Hang around the Flats near where the Cuyahoga enters Lake Erie and you&#x2019;ll get the notion that beautiful women are apparently de rigueur as a boating accessory.</p> <p>Fortified by a tuna-and-pasta salad, one of my pathetic periodic attempts to cut down on my consumption of red meat, I got back to the office before two o&#x2019;clock and waited for my appointment.</p> <p>He arrived on time, at two-thirty.</p> <p>He was a dapper little man, comfortably weighing about fifteen pounds more than he should have, in a brown tweed jacket that was too heavy for the weather, and a little bow tie that somehow managed not to look ridiculous on him and made me feel sadly underdressed in my open-collared shirt. Only a sparse fringe of tightly-cropped light brown hair ringed his otherwise bald pate, and he had one of those round, sweet, pinkish faces that had gone sour in the middle. I figured him to be in his middle fifties. In one short-fingered hand he clutched a leather folder that looked new.</p> <p>&#x201c;Mr. Jacovich, thank you for seeing me,&#x201d; he said when he walked in the door. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m William Carnine.&#x201d; He gave it the long i, rhyming it with the number nine. We shook hands and he sat down on the edge of one of my client chairs, clearly uneasy at being in the presence of a private investigator.</p> <p>I get that a lot.</p> <p>I offered him coffee or a soft drink, but he shook his head at the idea.</p> <p>&#x201c;How can I help you, Mr. Carnine?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Dr. Carnine, by the way,&#x201d; he said in a precise, fussy way. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m chairman of the biology department at Bryarly College.&#x201d;</p> <p>I had heard of it, a small and highly regarded private school on a lovely campus midway between Cleveland and Columbus, more celebrated for its English and writing programs and not so much for biology. His little aging-cherub face turned a trifle more red as he cleared his throat and took a breath that was so deep it became almost a desperate gasp for air.</p> <p>&#x201c;My daughter Ellen,&#x201d; he said on the exhale, &#x201c;is the woman who jumped off the Lorain-Carnegie Bridge last week. Perhaps you read about it?&#x201d;</p> <p>That was why his name had sounded familiar. Ellen Carnine. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very sorry.&#x201d; The words rang impotent and hollow; it is not in the nature of things for parents to outlive their children, and I knew he must be devastated.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he said, and then fell morosely silent. I didn&#x2019;t have the heart to prod him further, so I just waited until he was ready.</p> <p>It took a while.</p> <p>&#x201c;Mr. Jacovich,&#x201d; he said when he had finally mustered his courage or marshaled his thoughts, &#x201c;I have no idea why my daughter would take her own life. It&#x2019;s eating me up inside.&#x201d;</p> <p>I had no doubt that it was, even though he didn&#x2019;t look like anything ever bothered him very much; I intuited that his sour look was perpetual, almost institutionalized. He was the kind of formal, correct man it was inconceivable to imagine wearing a polo shirt, watching a football game, or eating Doritos.</p> <p>&#x201c;Was she ill?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, not that I know of. And the medical examiner&#x2019;s report didn&#x2019;t indicate anything like that.&#x201d; He kind of gestured at me with the leather folder, so I deduced that the coroner&#x2019;s report was inside.</p> <p>&#x201c;Could it have been because of a love affair gone bad?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I hardly think so,&#x201d; he said dismissively, shaking his head and closing his eyes briefly as he did so, and I found it curious enough to make a mental note that he&#x2019;d said it that way.</p> <p>&#x201c;Was she having money problems?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No. She wasn&#x2019;t wealthy, but she made a very good living, and she had a small trust fund from her grandmother.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Career problems, then?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She was the senior vice president of a medium-sized Internet company here in Cleveland. Quite a remarkable achievement for a woman not yet thirty.&#x201d; He said it with a sort of ravaged pride.</p> <p>&#x201c;Clinical depression, then?&#x201d;</p> <p>He shook his head. &#x201c;I think I would have known.&#x201d;</p> <p>I wasn&#x2019;t enjoying my role; I&#x2019;m a private investigator, not a behavioral psychologist, and I was suddenly tired of the guessing game. &#x201c;Dr. Carnine, there are many reasons people decide, rightly or wrongly, that it&#x2019;s simply too much trouble to go on.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m aware of that,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I live on campus at the college, and Ellen moved up here five years ago, so I have no idea what her life was like. Her day-to-day life. As a father, I need to know. Mrs. Carnine and I need the closure.&#x201d;</p> <p>He was one of those people who referred to his wife as &#x201c;Mrs.&#x201d; in conversation, I noted. And I wondered what people used to say before the word &#x201c;closure&#x201d; became fashionable about twenty years ago.</p> <p>&#x201c;We need to find out why,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;For our own peace of mind.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; I should have heeded the warning bell that rang when I first heard his name; failing to do so was a lot like noticing a red traffic light and barreling through the intersection anyway. But not paying attention to the chiming of warning bells was a personal failing of mine. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;d like me to look into it for you?&#x201d;</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dr. Carnine, I think you should know that the bulk of my work is industrial. I can give you the name of other investigators here in town who would be much better equipped to . . . &#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know your reputation, Mr. Jacovich. In the past few years you&#x2019;ve engendered a certain amount of&#x2015;publicity in this city. And we do get the Cleveland newspapers down in Bryarly.&#x201d;</p> <p>I winced at that one. I bend over backwards to avoid getting my name and picture in the newspaper or on television, but things don&#x2019;t always work out the way I&#x2019;d like them to, and I had been involved in several very high profile cases over the past few years, one involving a Hollywood movie star.</p> <p>&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; Carnine continued, &#x201c;you come highly recommended.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;By whom?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;When Ellen. . . When she died, we were of course in contact with the Cleveland police.

Throughout her writing career Welty&#39;s camera was a close companion. The one hundred pictures included here are her selections from many she took during the Great Depression as she traveled in her home state of Mississippi. These pictures are poignant images of human endurance. For her, looking back in 1971, they showed a record of a time and a place, an impoverished world that against great odds sustained a sense of community. Both black and white, the men, women, and children she photographed, unaware that they are coping with dire conditions, press onward with their lives. &#34;The Depression, in fact&#34;, Welty says in her introduction, &#34;was not a noticeable phenomenon in the poorest state in the Union&#34;. In the foreword to this Silver Anniversary Edition of One Time, One Place William Maxwell, Eudora Welty&#39;s dear friend and esteemed colleague in literature, offers an appreciation of this photographer&#39;s special genius and a loving glimpse into her artistic world.An acclaimed southern author&#39;s soul-stirring photographic images of her homeland during the 1930s. Silver Anniversary Edition</p><h2>Young Classics Heidi (Young Classics)</h2><p>This retelling of Heidi&#39;s story is charming and accessible to younger readers. Heidi has come to live with her grandfather in the mountains. Everything is new and exciting -- the wind in the fir trees, the pretty Alpine flowers, Peter and his goats, and most of all, Grandfather. Life on the mountain is beautiful, but it doesn&#39;t last forever. Heidi is taken to the big city of Frankfurt, where she becomes a companion to a little girl called Clara. How different life in this rich household is! Heidi does not know how to behave in the city and longs to go back to her mountain home. A classic story of a child&#39;s growing understanding of the world, Johanna Spyri&#39;s Heidi is especially engaging in this Young Classic edition because children can see what Heidi&#39;s life was really like. Photography sets the scene without intruding on the story and brings Heidi to life for a new generation of children.</p><p>Johanna Spyri's classic story of a young orphan sent to live with her grumpy grandfather in the Swiss Alps is retold in it's entirety in this beautifully bound hardcover edition. <i>Heidi</i> has charmed and intrigued readers since it's original publication in 1880. Much more than a children's story, the narrative is also a lesson on the precarious nature of freedom, a luxury too often taken for granted. Heidi almost loses her liberty as she is ripped away from the tranquility of the mountains to tend to a sick cousin in the city. Happily, all's well that ends well, and the reader is left with only warm, fuzzy thoughts. Spryi's story will never grow wearisome--and this is a very appealing edition. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Complete Peter Rabbit</h2><p>This complete and unabridged collection contains all 23 of Beatrix Potter's Tales in one deluxe volume with all their original illustrations.

His life coincided with an extraordinary time in history: the first half of the miraculous seventeenth century, replete with genius in the arts and sciences, and wracked by civil and international conflicts across Europe. But at his birth in 1596 the world was still dominated by medieval beliefs in phenomena such as miracles and spontaneous generation. It was Descartes who identified the intellectual tools his peers needed to free themselves from the grip of religious authority and in doing so he founded modern philosophy.<br>In this new biography, A. C. Grayling tells the story of Descartes' life, and places it in his tumultuous times&#x2015;with the unexpected result that an entirely new aspect of the story comes to light.</p></p><p><p>A.C. Grayling is professor of philosophy at Birkbeck College, University of London. Among his recent books are a biography of William Hazlitt, <i>The Meaning of Things</i>, and <i>The Reason of Things</i>. He writes a regular column for <i>The Times</i> of London.</p><p>&#x201c;In <i>Descartes</i>, A.C. Grayling...deftly conjures up the political and religious conflicts of Bohemia and France, Spain and Holland, and brings to life those distant characters and events that began to shape modern Europe...He makes a convincing case that Descartes had a minor role as some kind of intelligence agent in the affairs of the day.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Simon Blackburn, New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;As Newton was to physics, so Descartes was to philosophy, moving it from superstition and religion to science and reason. They are the founding fathers of the modern world. Grayling's life of Descartes is set firmly in the age of the Counter-Reformation and the Thirty Years War, which are evoked in a lively, almost novelistic style of which Descartes would certainly have approved. This propels the narrative forward and illuminates the philosophy for a lay readership.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Times (London)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Grayling's account of the man and the thinker, which aims &#x2018;to engage in conversation with non-specialists,' navigates a careful path between the colourfully anecdotal and the challengingly scholarly, and succeeds admirably in producing an elegant, subtle and historically informed portrait of one of the found fathers of modernity... excellent intellectual biography.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sunday Times (London)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Cogito ergo sum (I think, therefore I am)," said Rene Descartes in the mid 17th Century - the most famous philosophical sentence ever uttered... As Grayling vividly conveys, in a era of deference to religious authority, this was revolutionary&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Mail on Sunday (4 stars)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Grayling's profile of Ren� Descartes (1596&#x2013;1650) is a general-interest biography that follows the life stages and travels of the flesh-and-blood Descartes (those wanting a more scholarly approach should seek out Stephen Gaukroger's <i>Descartes,</i> 1995). Between his birth in rural France and his death at the Swedish royal court are curious gaps of biographical knowledge that invite plausible hypothesizing. Descartes' relation to the Rosicrucians, a supposed secret society, is mulled over by science historian Amir Aczel in <i>Descartes' Secret Notebook</i> (2005), as Grayling does here, albeit briefly. More lengthily, Grayling is intrigued by Descartes' presence, on the Catholic Hapsburg side, France's enemy, at key events in the outbreak of the Thirty Years War. Grayling cautiously proposes that Descartes was a Jesuit spy. True or not, espionage enlivens what is otherwise Descartes' sedentary story of philosophical reflection, which Grayling tracks chiefly through surviving correspondence. These offer glimpses of Descartes' sociable personality, although he was prone to anger when crossed on points of intellectual pride.

In attempting to interpret such a revolutionary proposition in a more &#x2018;humane&#x2019; light, and to turn Kant into our contemporary&#x2014;someone who can help us with our own ethical dilemmas&#x2014;many Kantian scholars have glossed over its apparent paradoxes and impossible claims. This book is concerned with doing exactly the opposite. Kant, thank God, is not our contemporary; he stands against the grain of our times.&nbsp;<br><br>Lacan on the face of it appears the very antithesis of Kant&#x2014;the wild theorist of psychoanalysis compared to the sober Enlightenment thinker. His concept of the Real, however, provides perhaps the most useful backdrop to this new interpretation of Kantian ethics. Constantly juxtaposing her readings of the two philosophers. Alenka Zupan?i? summons up an &#x2018;ethics of the Real&#x2019;, and clears the ground for a radical restoration of the disruptive element in ethics.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Alenka Zupan?i?</b> is a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy in the Slovene Academy of Sciences, Ljublijana&#x201c;If Zupancic's book does not become a classic work of reference, the only conclusion will be that our academia is caught in an obscure desire to self-destruct.&#x201d;&#x2014;Slavoj i ek</p><h2>No Man&#39;s Land: 1918, The Last Year of the Great War</h2><p>From freezing infantrymen huddled in bloodied trenches on the front lines to intricate political maneuvering and tense strategy sessions in European capitals, noted historian John Toland tells of the unforgettable final year of the First World War. As 1918 opened, the Allies and Central Powers remained locked in a desperate, bloody stalemate, despite the deaths of millions of soldiers over the previous three and a half years. The arrival of the Americans &#34;over there&#34; by the middle of the year turned the tide of war, resulting in an Allied victory in November.In these pages participants on both sides, from enlisted men to generals and prime ministers to monarchs, vividly recount the battles, sensational events, and behind-the-scenes strategies that shaped the climactic, terrifying year. It&#39;s all here-the horrific futility of going over the top into a hail of bullets in no man&#39;s land; the enigmatic death of the legendary German ace, the Red Baron; Operation Michael, a punishing German attack in the spring; the Americans&#39; long-awaited arrival in June; the murder of Russian Czar Nicholas II and his family, the growing fear of a communist menace in the east; and the armistice on November 11. The different points of view of Germans, Americans, British, French, and Russians add depth, complexity, and understanding to the tragedies and triumphs of the War to End All Wars.</p><p><p><b>John Toland</b> (1912-2004) was an award-winning American author and one of the most widely read military historians of the twentieth century. His most well-known work is perhaps <i>The Rising Sun</i>, winner of the 1971 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction and the first book in English to tell the story of the Pacific War from the Japanese perspective. Although primarily an author of historical nonfiction, Toland also wrote novels, plays, and short stories. Among his published books were four <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers: <i>But Not in Shame</i>, <i>The Last Hundred Days</i>, <i>Adolf Hitler</i>, and <i>Infamy</i>.</p></p><h2>The Family Idiot: Gustave Flaubert, 1821-1857, Volume 3</h2><p>Seen by many as the culmination of Sartre's thought and project, and viewed by Sartre himself as an attempt to answer the question, "What, at this point in time, can we know about a man?" this monumental work continues to perplex its fascinated critics and admirers, who have argued about its precise nature. However, as reviews of the first volume in this translation agreed, whatever <i>The Family Idiot</i> may be called&#x2014;"a dialectic" (Fredric Jameson, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>); "biography, philosophy, or politics? Surely . . . all of these together" (Renee Winegarten, <i>Commentary</i>); "a new form of fiction?" (Victor Brombert, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>); or simply, "mad, of course" (Julian Barnes, <i>London Review of Books</i>)&#x2014;its prominent place in intellectual history is indisputable.<br><br>Volume 3 consists of "School Years" and "Preneurosis," which are the second and third books of part 2 of the original French work. In vivid detail, Sartre renders Flaubert's secondary-school experiences and relationships: his part in a student rebellion against the faculty, his teenage infatuation with Romantic literature, his friendships and rivalries with his classmates, and the ironies inherent in the schoolboys' bourgeois existence. Sartre then discusses Flaubert's years at law school, where he studied at his father's insistence. This volume also contains Sartre's most sustained analysis of <i>Madame Bovary</i>. Sartre's approach to his complex subject, whether jaunty or judicious, psychoanalytical or political, is captured in all of its rich variety in Carol Cosman's translation.</p><p><b>Carol Cosman</b> is coeditor of <i>The Other Voice</i> and <i>The Penguin Book of Women Poets</i>.

Tupper Saussy, a native of the southeastern United States, spent ten years as a fugitive from the IRS, the period during which he did the research for this book. A true Renaissance man, he has been nominated three times for a Grammy Award, is a distinguished watercolorist, and is the author of the bestselling book <i>The Miracle on Main Street.</i> He lives in Santa Monica, California.<p></p>Saussy, a Grammy-nominated songwriter and author (Miracle on Main Street) turned conspiracy theorist, makes a case here that will strike most readers as awash in bigotry (of the anti-Catholic variety): "[T]he papacy really does run United States foreign policy, and always has." To prove that, for example, the pope controls Washington, Saussy offers "evidence" such as the number of Catholic senators and other high government officials or that "the land known today as the District of Columbia bore the name `Rome' in 1663 property records." Further, he argues that the Jesuits "have imbued western culture with a purely Catholic political theory" the theory underlying the American Revolution, which in turn was brought about by a Jesuit priest, Lorenzo Ricci (aka Laurence Richey), as part of a plan to make America safe for Roman Catholics. Catholics were oppressed in colonial times, Saussy notes, but Catholic immigrants flooded into the U.S. from Europe in the decades following the Revolution. This book has a blurb from fellow HarperCollins author and conspiracy theorist Jim Marrs, and the publisher, in a press release and apparently asleep at the wheel, calls it a "riveting, well-researched and well-documented account of one man's discovery of the true driving forces behind our nation's history." But most will see it for what it really is an anti-Catholic version of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Warped Factors: A Neurotic&#39;s Guide to the Universe</h2><p>The actor best known for his work on the Star Trek television series and films traces his life and career and offers his perspective on the success and evolution of Star Trek</p><p>Walter Koenig, &#34;Star Trek&#39;s&#34; Ensign Pavel Chekov, has come a long way since his neurotic school days. With warmth, humor, scatology and frankness, he describes a long and interesting life; most recently he has been appearing in &#34;Babylon 5&#34; and has also written, produced and acted in various plays and films. Though he is descended from Russian immigrants, he is not one himself, and only when making a humorous aside does he invoke Ensign Chekov&#39;s accent. So think of that voice without the accent, expressive and even kind, and you&#39;ll know how this book sounds. You&#39;ll even like the guy. D.R.W. (c) AudioFile, Portland, MaineKnown primarily for his role as the confident Pavel Chekov in the Star Trek series and films, Koenig (Chekov's Enterprise) offers a surprisingly fretful memoir, focusing on his lifelong battle with neurosis and the toll it has taken on his personal and professional relationships. The book's first half covers Koenig's childhood experiences and early TV roles, with the remainder devoted mainly to his career on the U.S.S. Enterprise. Even success in early TV roles on Combat! and General Hospital failed to mitigate Koenig's "Quasimodo" self-image, which carried over into his worldwide success with Star Trek. He often complains about his treatment on the show: regretting that producer Gene Roddenberry ignored his script ideas, feeling dismissed by Spock actor Leonard Nimoy and envying George Takei's (Sulu) sword-wielding performance in "The Naked Time" episode. Koenig's honesty, humor and obvious intelligence do much to enliven the book (one of several intros hilariously sends up the entire crew), as do flashes of terrific writing. But the Star Trek show and films have been reported upon innumerable times, and so this book, for all its charms, will likely appeal mostly to diehard Trekkies.

But she has no idea what she's getting into when she agrees to work for infamous antiques dealer Elliot Littlefield.</p><p>The first day on the job she and her crew discover the bloodied body of a young woman in a bedroom -- and are soon on the trail of a priceless Civil War diary stolen by the killer. As if two crimes aren't enough, deadly serious collectors, right-wing radicals, and impulsive teenagers make the case even more difficult to tidy up ... and more dangerous.</p></p><p><p><strong>Kathy Hogan Trocheck</strong> is the author of ten critically acclaimed mysteries, including the Callahan Garrity mystery series. A former reporter for the <em>Atlanta Journal Constitution</em>, she is also the author of <em>Little Bitty Lies</em> and the Edgar�- and Macavity-nominated <em>Savannah Blues</em>, under the name Mary Kay Andrews.</p>While some mannerly mysteries call for a cup of tea and a plate of scones, Trocheck's Georgia-based tale suggests iced coffee and cornbread. The second appearance of sleuth Callahan Garrity, a 34-year-old former policewoman who runs the "House Mouse" cleaning service, offers the smooth writing and feisty characters introduced in the notable Every Crooked Nanny . While sprucing up the messy mansion of racist Civil War buff Elliott Littlefield, Callahan's cleaners find the bloody corpse of a 17-year-old girl. Although a similar homicide occurred in his home 20 years earlier, Littlefield maintains his innocence, insisting that the killer also stole the valuable diary of a Civil War madam. Hired by Littlefield to investigate the robbery, Callahan plainly itches to implicate her Rebel-loving employer in the murder. Callahan's detective pursuits merge seamlessly with details of her home-based relationships with her nosy mother and steady beau, with attention also given to Callahan's earlier bout with breast cancer and a teenage character's bulimia. Even though the roster of eccentric House Mouse employees is less involved than before, other memorable Southern personalities and on-target dialogue lift this appealing whodunit well above the norm. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Pope John XXIII: A Penguin Life (Penguin Lives)</h2><p>The author&#39;s trademark blend of profound insight and extensive knowledge provides a fascinating history of the Catholic Church and the papacy by focusing on Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli as Pope John XXIII, who awed the world with the seminal and unprecedented change he brought about due to his concern for humankind. 35,000 first printing.</p><p>The punchy Penguin Lives series is the best thing to hit popular biography in some time, and Thomas Cahill is just the fun and erudite guy to Penguinize Pope John XXIII. He captures both the irresistible character of Angelo "Little Angel" Giuseppe Roncalli, a peasant born in backwards Bergamo, and his place in world and church history. In fact, Cahill shows, as John XXIII, Angelo brought the church into the modern world in the 1960s, upsetting the poisoned apple cart of his nefarious predecessor, Pius X, whom Cahill convincingly likens to a Joe McCarthy with the private meanness of Nixon. John XXIII anticipated liberation theology by seven decades, reached out to Protestants and even non-Christians, and saved thousands of Jews from Hitler by wily machinations Cahill aptly compares to Paul's epistle to Philemon. (Cahill says it's unfair to brand Angelo's immediate predecessor, Pius XII, as <i>Hitler's Pope</i>--though he was a "moral pygmy" next to the giant John XXIII.) Cahill gives a quickie history of the Papacy that generations of cramming history students will thank God for, and includes just enough about Pope John's irreverent wit and way of life--the La Grenouille chef, the Jackie Kennedy friendship, the possibly apocryphal quip to a buxom woman wearing a crucifix ("What a Golgotha!").

The magic in Horvath's story, however, lies not in talking bugs but in the hearts and minds of its characters. Thirteen-year-old Ratchet Clark, a girl with a deformity on her shoulder blade her breezily cruel, self-absorbed mother calls "That Thing," is unceremoniously kicked out for the summer while her mom attends to important things, like how to gain entry into the prestigious Pensacola country club. Mom drops Ratchet off at her great second-cousins' enormous, turreted house in Maine, a remote seaside estate surrounded by oily blueberry bogs and bears.<p> What starts out as a fairly grim proposition transforms as Ratchet befriends the endearing, downright hilarious 91-year-old twins Aunt Tilly and Aunt Penpen who are "as different as chalk and cheese" and learns the ways of rural Maine. When another unwanted teenage girl named Harper ("obnoxious, but strangely compelling") enters the scene, the household dynamic changes yet again. Though fairytale-like in its setting and its charm, do not be fooled. Suicide, decapitation, wretched mothers, and a sprinkling of profanity pepper this poignant, philosophical, darkly humorous novel that dips into subjects from technology to love to death. In Horvath's capable hands, readers are left believing in the best of human nature as she switches effortlessly from the sublime to the ridiculous and back again. Wild stories, brilliant dialogue, and vats of compassion distinguish Newbery Honor author Horvath's latest offering.

In <i>The Plague of Fantasies</i> i ek approaches another enormous subject with characteristic brio and provocativeness. The current epoch is plagued by fantasms: there is an ever intensifying antagonism between the process of ever greater abstraction of our lives&#x2014;whether in the form of digitalization or market relations&#x2014;and the deluge of pseudo-concrete images which surround us. Traditional critical thought would have sought to trace the roots of abstract notions in concrete social reality; but today, the correct procedure is the inverse&#x2014;from pseudo-concrete imagery to the abstract process which structures our lives.<br><br>Ranging in his examples from national differences in toilet design to cybersex, and from intellectuals&#x2019; responses to the Bosnian war to Robert Schumann&#x2019;s music, i ek explores the relations between fantasy and ideology, the way in which fantasy animates enjoy-ment while protecting against its excesses, the associations of the notion of fetishism with fantasized seduction, and the ways in which digitalization and cyberspace affect the status of subjectivity. To the already initiated, <i>The Plague of Fantasies</i> will be a welcome reminder of why they enjoy i ek&#x2019;s writing so much.

Before creating his canon of classic, hilarious children&#x2019;s books, James Marshall played the viola, studied French, and received a master&#x2019;s degree from Trinity College. He also doodled.

On their day-long travels, they run into a series of other Stupid relatives, and finally return home. Few books delight young readers more than wonderfully silly offerings, such as Judith Barrett's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (Atheneum, 1978) and Mercer Mayer's What Do You Do with a Kangaroo? (Scholastic, 1975), in which children's growing knowledge of the real world lets them in on the joke. Allard and Marshall have filled the pages of this book with lots of silliness and sight gags--but if a book is nothing but a series of bad puns and weak humor, it falls flat. Some readers might enjoy this latest of the Stupid adventures, but many will find it more like a collection of bad knock-knock jokes. While The Stupids Step Out (1974) and The Stupids Have a Ball (1978) had cohesive stories and wit, this entry resembles The Stupids Die (1981, all Houghton) in its lame attempt to entertain.

William Langston and writer Jon Palfreman recount the bizarre and far-reaching mystery of six patients who arrived at San Francisco area emergency rooms after using a synthetic analogue of heroin. Fully conscious but unable to move or speak, they were soon diagnosed by Langston as having advanced Parkinson&#39;s disease. This spellbinding book offers a stunning report on these baffling cases. of photos.</p><p>In 1982, six patients appeared in California clinics displaying mysterious symptoms: their bodies were so stiff that they appeared to be frozen. Langston, currently the president of the California Parkinson's Foundation, was one of the first physicians to examine the patients. He discovered that they had all injected a "designer" drug into their systems that created symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. Through excellent detective work and a good deal of pure luck, Langston located the chemical MPTP, which also produced Parkinsonian symptoms in primates. That discovery was of supreme medical importance, providing Langston and other researchers with the ability to test Parkinson's treatments on animal models. New approaches, including fetal tissue transplantation, could now be pursued. Langston's book intersperses discussions of recent research on Parkinson's while continuing to report on the progress of the "frozen addicts." A fast-paced medical detective format makes this a fascinating and immensely informative work. Highly recommended for most libraries.?Tina Neville, Univ. of South Florida at St. Petersburg Lib.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.The fascinating story of 12 years in Langston's career takes him from clinician to organizer of the Parkinson's Institute in California. In the process and with the aid of his growing staff and several Swedish physicians, he "thawed out" George, Juanita, and Connie, three of six addicts he'd been called to see in 1982. The six had suddenly shown signs of advanced Parkinson's disease that included inflexible or "frozen" bodies and inability to communicate. An alert and imaginative neurologist, Langston eventually suspected a chemical cause because of indications that all six were addicted to heroin or had used at least some just before the onset of symptoms. Ultimately, Langston unlocked his patients to the point at which a long and tortuous medical detective story could begin. The happy conclusion for the successfully thawed three came after the use of various experimental drugs and the transplanting of, first, adrenal, and finally, fetal, tissues. Readers of many stripes should find this well-told tale exciting. <i>William Beatty</i></p><h2>Understanding Installation Art: From Drchamp to Holzer</h2><p>Shows ink to text</p><p></p><h2>The Case of the Baited Hook</h2><p>Who was the masked woman?

Roman Polanski drives a rented Mercedes along Mulholland Drive to Jack Nicholson&#x2019;s house. Sitting next to him is an aspiring actress, Samantha Geimer, recently arrived from York, Pennsylvania. She is thirteen years old. <br> <br>The undisputed facts of what happened in the following hours appear in the court record: Polanski spent hours taking pictures of Samantha&#x2014;on a deck overlooking the Hollywood Hills, on a kitchen counter, topless in a Jacuzzi. Wine and Quaaludes were consumed, balance and innocence were lost, and a young girl&#x2019;s life was altered forever&#x2014;eternally cast as a background player in her own story.<br> <br>For months on end, the Polanski case dominated the media in the United States and abroad. But even with the extensive coverage, much about that day&#x2014;and the girl at the center of it all&#x2014;remains a mystery. Just about everyone had an opinion about the renowned director and the girl he was accused of drugging and raping. Who was the predator? Who was the prey? Was the girl an innocent victim or a cunning Lolita artfully directed by her ambitious stage mother? How could the criminal justice system have failed all the parties concerned in such a spectacular fashion? Once Polanski fled the country, what became of Samantha, the young girl forever associated with one of Hollywood&#x2019;s most notorious episodes? Samantha, as much as Polanski, has been a fugitive since the events of that night more than thirty years ago.<br> <br> Taking us far beyond the headlines, <i>The Girl </i>reveals a thirteen-year-old who was simultaneously wise beyond her years and yet terribly vulnerable.

A chill in the air, snow on the mountaintops, leaves cinnamon and gold&#x2014;so different from the glorious monotony of our Hawaii weather. My husband and I were in the middle of a long-anticipated vacation on the mainland&#x2014;celebrating family birthdays, catching trout, watching elk rut. We were feeling particularly festive. At 6:00 AM Dave left our hotel to fish. I collapsed gratefully back into bed. At 8:15 AM the phone rang.<br> <br>It was my friend Dawn. She was always looking out for me. &#x201c;I have to tell you something, and you have to wake up and be ready,&#x201d; she said. I was instantly awake. I knew something bad had happened to her. I steeled myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;Roman Polanski got arrested.&#x201d;<br> <br>Oh God. This wasn&#x2019;t her bad news. This was my bad news.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sam? Did you hear what I said?&#x201d;<br> <br>When I&#x2019;m upset, I curse. I can&#x2019;t help it. I become a fourteen-year-old boy. &#x201c;Shit shit shit shit, what the fuck.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They arrested him in Switzerland,&#x201d; Dawn said. &#x201c;I just heard it on the news.&#x201d;<br> <br>Sickness, panic. Need my family. Need my mother. Need a Xanax.<br> <br>CNN had the story:<br> <br>Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski has been arrested in Switzerland on a decades-old arrest warrant stemming from a sex charge in California, Swiss police said Sunday.<br> <br>Polanski, 76, was taken into custody trying to enter Switzerland on Saturday, Zurich police said. A spokesman for the Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was arrested upon arrival at the airport.<br> <br>He has lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the United States and declined to appear in person to collect his Academy Award for Best Director for &#x201c;The Pianist&#x201d; in 2003.<br> <br>The director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, acknowledging he had sex with a 13-year-old girl. But he fled the United States before he could be sentenced, and U.S. authorities have had a warrant for his arrest since 1978.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s a problem: This story doesn&#x2019;t mention the insanity that preceded his flight&#x2014;the egomaniacal judge, the unconscionable uncertainty of the sentencing, the case being played out not in the courtroom, but in the media.<br> <br>And here&#x2019;s another problem: Roman Polanski&#x2019;s arrest was, in a sense, my arrest. Because I am that thirteen-year-old girl.<br> <br>Oh for God&#x2019;s sakes, it&#x2019;s all such ancient history, you might say. After all, it&#x2019;s 2013: he&#x2019;s eighty, I&#x2019;m fifty. He is one of the most celebrated filmmakers in the world. I have a great husband, great kids, a great life. What do his problems, at this point, have to do with me?<br> <br>Well, nothing. And everything.<br> <br>To say that the Roman Polanski rape case was a circus is only the mildest exaggeration. For the media, there was nothing to equal its heady combination of sex, celebrity, and depravity until the O. J. Simpson trial in 1995. Just about everyone who lived through or read about this sordid chapter in Hollywood history had an opinion about the renowned director and the girl he was accused of drugging, raping, and sodomizing&#x2014;me.<br> <br>Opinions on the Polanski case go something like this: He was a vile pedophile whose power allowed him to escape the long arm of the law. Or: He was a troubled man whose own horrific background did not allow him to gauge the difference between a child and a young woman. And the girl? She was an innocent victim. Or, no: She was a cunning Lolita. Or, perhaps most commonly: She was a reluctant but ultimately willing player in the crazy ambitions of her stage mother, who wanted her little girl to be a star.<br> <br>Who was the predator? Who was the prey? We were all suspect: Was Roman a rapist? Had my mother set up the famous director to blackmail him, using her daughter as bait? The arguments went on and on and on. Maybe the only person who lived through that time who has not weighed in on the crime and its aftermath in any significant way is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. me. Which is why I thought it might be a good idea to tell my story.<br> <br>But these thoughts only occurred to me a few months after Polanski&#x2019;s arrest. That day, I was in a very different frame of mind. I was thinking: Goodbye, peace. Hello, Media Nightmare. Because I knew that whenever Polanski was in the news, I would be, too.<br> <br>Ask yourself this: Would you like the craziest thing that ever happened to you as a teenager broadcast and then dissected over and over on television, in the blogosphere?<br> <br>Right. I didn&#x2019;t think so.<br> <br>I called home and told my sons to unplug the phone&#x2014;there were already thirty messages that had landed in the first few hours, and within the next couple of days my lawyer, Lawrence Silver, would be inundated. As much as I dreaded any time Roman Polanski was in the news, I never imagined that the appetite for this story would lead reporters to show up on Kauai. On my doorstep. My sons became prisoners in their own home. Photographers had staked out space in front of my property, sitting in their cars, waiting and drinking stale coffee. What did Rape Girl look like now? Was she fat, thin, pretty, wrinkly? Imagine how much my sons, who were then seventeen, twenty-one, and twenty-seven, enjoyed thinking about why their mom was getting this attention. Nobody likes to think about their mother getting kissed, never mind something like this.<br> <br>As soon as I heard, I called Dave: &#x201c;Sorry, fishing trip is over. We have problems. Come back now.&#x201d; I called Mom, who&#x2019;d been staying with my aunt up the road. &#x201c;What did he do now?&#x201d; she asked. It didn&#x2019;t occur to her that his arrest, thirty-two years later, could have anything to do with me.<br> <br>We made our way to Denver, staying overnight in a hotel near the airport. Roman&#x2019;s arrest was in all the newspapers and running on the ticker on the news channels. My face was on all the televisions in the lobby bar. &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s staring,&#x201d; Dave whispered. Were they? I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe it was his imagination. I kept my head down. But the woman at the front desk noticed my photo in the Denver paper and upgraded us to a more secure floor. I was so grateful to that hotel, because that would be the last time I&#x2019;d have any peace for the next few weeks.<br> <br>In the Hawaiian airport a smattering of photographers were waiting for us. How did they even know what flight I was on? I guess all airline companies have moles. It was uncomfortable, but it was quickly over. Still, Dave and I had no choice: I couldn&#x2019;t go home and face the paparazzi. We slept that night at my office. A couple of days later, an article ran that said I was &#x201c;clearly upset and looking tired and drawn.&#x201d; More like exhausted and furious.<br> <br>By the time I dared to go home, most of the stalkerazzi had grumpily given up camping outside my door. I had to hand it to my sons; they helped. They monitored the cars parked in front of the house, and shouted at anyone who came by to gawk; my son Alex even went out and continually photographed one of the photographers until he left. They had to discourage their friends from confronting the photographers; my sons were having to be peacekeepers as well.<br> <br>Over the next few days, we would receive more than two hundred calls, almost all from the press, and that doesn&#x2019;t include the ones that came to Larry&#x2019;s office. At the same time, my husband&#x2019;s cousins&#x2014;the Geimer relations in California&#x2014;were dealing with people knocking on their door. Geimer was an uncommon name, and reporters figured these people might have some idea where I was and what I was up to. Probably, in the minds of these media folks, I was having horrible flashbacks from decades ago. I was&#x2014;but it was horrible flashbacks of them.<br> <br>Why would all this be happening now? True, the United States could have sought Polanski&#x2019;s arrest and extradition worldwide at any time since 1978. But at that moment, we knew nothing. I never even realized Polanski could leave France; I had no idea he had a chalet in Switzerland and traveled, semi-covertly, in and out of several countries. At the moment all I could think was, Why would he do something so stupid? And why should I have to live through it all&#x2014;again?<br> <br>I called my lawyer, Larry Silver, who said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what this is about, either. Do nothing. I&#x2019;ll find out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Something, or someone, had stirred up old wounds. Maybe Steven Cooley, the Republican district attorney of Los Angeles&#x2014;who, not coincidentally, was running for state attorney general&#x2014;felt he had to show everyone who was the big macher and push for resolution in this famously unresolved case.<br> <br>I suddenly recalled how uncomfortable I&#x2019;d felt for many years in California, and in Los Angeles in particular. Celebrity didn&#x2019;t just count for a lot; to a certain segment of the population, it was everything. And wherever a celebrity was involved, all emotions loomed large. Adulation, yes. But retribution, too. I had this sense that the entire legal system was saying to Polanski, You think you&#x2019;re better than us? Well, just wait.<br> <br>The purpose of the legal system is to punish criminals, of course, and there were many ideas about what this meant for Polanski&#x2014;had he been punished enough for what he did? Did he still deserve to be held accountable? Or had the punishment been bungled so stupendously that anything further was cruel and unusual? And then there was the other purpose of the judicial system: to protect victims and protect society from criminals. So what was the sense of arresting Polanski now? Did society need to be protected from him? Did I?<br> <br>Over the years, I have had bad dreams about the legal morass, the publicity, the questioning in the courtroom. But I don&#x2019;t think I ever dreamed about Roman or that night at Jack Nicholson&#x2019;s house. That doesn&#x2019;t mean it wasn&#x2019;t terrible. It was. But its terribleness didn&#x2019;t haunt me. Other aspects of that time did. When Roman was arrested in Switzerland, it wasn&#x2019;t exactly d�j� vu, but it reminded me of the sense of powerlessness I had experienced as a thirteen-year-old girl. With the passing years, it had come to seem less and less likely that Roman would ever return to the States. He would live and die a celebrated director in France, where he was beloved, and I would hold on to the anonymity I cherished. And if he were to return, I assumed it would be because he&#x2019;d resolved his legal problems and come back voluntarily. How could he be arrested again, thirty-two years later?<br> <br>In a blink everything had returned nearly to the way it was decades before. Roman was sitting in a jail cell, and I was being hounded by the press. It was just like all those many years ago when we first met Judge Rittenband, the man who oversaw the case: we were bound again by a legal system that valued the headlines it could generate more than the effect its actions had on individuals. His rights as a defendant, my rights as a victim, were being stomped into the ground.<br> <br>As the case moved again through the courts and old atrocities were revisited, my lawyer, Larry Silver, again beseeched the court to finally make the whole thing go away.<br> <br>&#x201c;The victim is once again the victim,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;Everyone claims that they are acting to vindicate justice, but Samantha sees no justice. Everyone insists that she owes them a story, but her story continues to be sad.<br> <br>&#x201c;She endures this life because a corrupt judge caused, understandably, Polanski to flee. No matter what his crime, Polanski was entitled to be treated fairly; he was not. The day Polanski fled was a sad day for American justice. Samantha should not be made to pay the price. She has been paying for a failed judicial and prosecutorial system.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This statement makes one more demand, one more request, one more plea: Leave her alone.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Now listen: I am not na�ve. If you write a book, you&#x2019;re not asking to be left alone. You&#x2019;re inviting people into your life. I know that. Welcome.<br> <br>But I do have a reason. So much has been written about the Polanski case, but none of it has been written by me, the person at the center of it. So many years have gone by; it&#x2019;s time. I&#x2019;ve had so many years to rage, to laugh, to marvel at what people say and why they say it. In a sense I want to take back ownership of my own story from those who&#x2019;ve commented on it, without rebuke, for so long. Because my story is not just pure awfulness. It&#x2019;s crazy and sad, but yes, sometimes funny, too. It may have been messy at times, but it&#x2019;s my mess and I&#x2019;m taking it back.<br> <br>There is even, as we parents say, a teachable moment. We have what I think of as a Victim Industry in this country, an industry populated by Nancy Grace and Dr. Phil and Gloria Allred and all those who make money by manufacturing outrage. I&#x2019;ve been part of it. If you spent years reading about yourself in the papers with the moniker &#x201c;Sex Victim Girl,&#x201d; you&#x2019;d have a lot to say about this issue, too. But for now I&#x2019;ll leave it at this: It is wrong to ask people to feel like victims, because once they do, they feel like victims in every area of their lives.<br> <br>I made a decision: I wasn&#x2019;t going to be a victim of anyone or for anyone.

She's also the local pharmacist, the co-captain of the Rescue Squad, and the director of The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, the town's long-running Outdoor Drama. Ave Maria is content with her life of doing errands and negotiating small details-until she discovers a skeleton in her family's formerly tidy closet that completely unravels her quiet, conventional life. Suddenly, she finds herself juggling two marriage proposals, conducting a no-holds-barred family feud, planning a life-changing journey to the Old Country, and helping her best friend, the high-school band director, design a halftime show to dazzle Elizabeth Taylor, the violet-eyed Hollywood movie star who's coming through town on a campaign stump with her husband, senatorial candidate John Warner.<br><br>Filled with big-time eccentrics and small-town shenanigans, <b>Big Stone Gap</b> is a jewel box of original characters, including sexpot Bookmobile librarian Iva Lou Wade; Fleeta Mullins, the chain-smoking pharmacy cashier with a penchant for professional wrestling; the dashing visionary Theodore Tipton; Elmo Gaspar, the snake-handling preacher; Jack MacChesney, a coal-mining bachelor looking for true love; and Pearl Grimes, a shy mountain girl on the verge of a miraculous transformation. <br><br>Comic and compassionate, <b>Big Stone Gap</b> is is the story of a woman who thinks life has passed her by, only to learn that the best is yet to come.</p><p>In the town of Big Stone Gap, Virginia, not much happens. The highlight of 35-year-old Ave Maria Mulligan's week comes on Friday, with the arrival of the Bookmobile, the sight of which sends her into raptures. Her favorite book concerns the ancient Chinese art of reading faces. Through her face-readings, we come to understand the hostilities simmering within her family: her father whose small eyes are the clear "sign of a deceptive nature." Her aunt who "has a small head and thin lips. (That's a terrible combination.)" Adriana Trigiani's first novel concerns the family scandals that befall Ave Maria in this seemingly uneventful town. Greed, lust, envy--all the ancient emotional elements--manifest themselves even in this hamlet of "ordinary folk." Fans of Fannie Flagg or Rebecca Wells will enjoy this down-home tale, full of small, everyday details and colloquial revelations. The writing is often awkward, but so too are the characters who inhabit this place: the Bookmobile lady who thinks of herself as the sexiest woman alive; the amateur actors in the local Outdoor Drama who bristle with ambition when they hear that Elizabeth Taylor is coming to visit. In Big Stone Gap, her visit is so anticipated, it's like she's an angel sent from heaven. <i>--Ellen Williams</i><br>"BIG STONE GAP is a southern novel that has the ring of truth, by which I mean<br>its characters are bizarre, its story is hilarious, and that it hooked me on<br>page one."<p><br>--John Berendt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"Have there ever been more engaging late bloomers than Ave Maria Mulligan and her circle of doting, meddlesome friends? Adriana Trigiani writes with wit and grace about misguided romances and family secrets, and so very winningly about generous hearts. This urban Yankee reader found hours of bliss in Big Stone Gap, Virginia."<br>-- Elinor Lipman<br>"Funny, charming and original!" <br>-- Fannie Flagg<br>"It is one of my all-time favorite novels . . . unforgettable." <br>-- Whoopi Goldberg<br>"I have not enjoyed a novel this much since Cold Mountain. The characters are exquisitely and richly drawn. Ave Maria Mulligan is so real, she is almost a miracle. The story is poignant without being sentimental, and funny without being mean, and the story, the people, and the place of Big Stone Gap have stayed with me long after reading the book." <br>-- Rosanne Cash<br><br></p></p><h2>Unforgiven</h2><p>Despite the fact that their families have been bitter rivals for nearly a century, Kenneth Woodfall returns home after an eight-year absence and realizes his undying love for Miss Moira Hayes, but fears she is unwilling to forget the past.

(The Revised 10th anniversary edition is now available, at Amazon.com/Meanwhile-Next-Door-Good-Life/dp/0972092447) This early book chronicles the 1970s when Jean and her first husband, a traumatized Vietnam veteran, homesteaded in Harborside, Maine on land bought from Helen and Scott Nearing, authors of <b>Living the Good Life.</b><p> With the help of letters Jean's mom saved and gave back to her, this memoir recounts the joys and pains of one woman's personal experience going back to the land, from personal and community dynamics, through several births and the many deaths in that neighborhood. </p><p> Beyond her own story, Jean also used her investigative reporting skills to examine some long-standing and nagging questions surrounding the Nearings. Her research turned up some surprising and enlightening facts about how Helen and Scott Nearing actually lived -- and died.</p><p>Part of the neighborhood dynamic Jean recounts involved abutters on the other side, Eliot and Sue Coleman (who also bought land from the Nearings), and their young daughters Melissa, Heidi and Clara. Eliot would later write several highly-popular gardening books, while some 40 years later (2011) Melissa would write her best-selling memoir, <b>This Life Is In Your Hands: One Dream, 60 acres, and a Family Undone</b>. Jean's book is the adult version of what happened on Cape Rosier during those years. The April 2012 paperback version of Melissa's book lists <b>Meanwhile, Next Door to the Good Life</b> among the sources for many of the non-family details woven through Melissa's text. </p><p> For those who want a closer look at <b>Living the Good Life</b> and how that best-selling Nearing book impacted real back-to-the-landers, <b>Meanwhile, Next Door to the Good Life</b> is for you.</p></p><p>Author Susan Hand Shetterly of Surry, Maine, sent this review to the publisher on Oct. 23, 2003 "Meanwhile, Next Door to the Good Life" is going to become one of those essential books to read in order to understand the back-to-the-land-movement in Maine. Jean Hay Bright's life in the woods may have been somewhat different from the lives of others trying to make their way out of what they felt was a society mired in corruption - trying to make their way toward a new and better choice - but there are themes common to all, and the first is the Vietnam War. No one should underestimate it. Another is the amount of hard labor we, as young homesteaders, were willing and able to do. To read Hay Bright's account is to bring back the joy of learning how to do for oneself: how to grow food, cook food, survive winters, raise chickens, raise children. Another is the desire to recreate something closer to the frontier family than the suburban family: a small, intense unit back-lit by a kerosene lamp. The War was an evil that came from outside and - if we were one of the lucky - just left us whip-lashed. What made those first, fresh-faced homesteading dreams die eventually came from what we carried inside us into the woods. The utopian life shattered under the weight of our own imperfections.<p> This is, in a sense, a story as old as time: a walk from innocence into experience. Who we believed in and some of what we believed in failed us. But the journey is important, and what Hay Bright knows we have left - after all this panning for gold - are the few bright nuggets of the real thing.</p>Jean Hay Bright was married to a Vietnam veteran when they moved to Maine to homestead in 1972. Her two children born that decade are now grown, her journalism career and political campaigns are behind her, and she now lives with her second husband on a small organic farm in central Maine.</p><h2>Elvis Presley&#39;s Graceland: The official guidebook, updated and expanded second edition</h2><p>Used.

Despite this, prospects for recovery have never been better, based on recent advances in psychology, auditory neuroscience and medicine. Tinnitus (colloquially known as ringing in the ears) is common, affecting some five percent of people. Hyperacusis, or hypersensitivity of hearing, is commonly associated with troublesome tinnitus. However, these basic definitions give no idea of the individual, even idiosyncratic nature of both disorders, which can be profoundly affected by someone&#39;s personality and psychological state. While this may complicate medical treatment, it does mean that self-help techniques can often be effective in minimizing the distress caused by these disorders, which can range from lack of sleep and irritability, to loss of concentration and confidence. This book looks at strategies for living with tinnitus and hyperacusis, and includes a complete programme for recovery. Topics include: causes and mechanisms of tinnitus and hyperacusis; the impact of these hearing disorders; effective treatments; relaxation and sound therapy; relieving the stress of tinnitus and hyperacusis; avoiding relapse</p><p>Dr David Baguley is Consultant Clinical Scientist and Head of Audiology at Addenbrooke&#39;s NHS Hospital Trust, Cambridge, and Raine Visiting Professor, University of Western Australia.

From his induction in 1971 until his retirement in 2011, Silber was unrelenting in improving the standards and quality of his university. What he may have lacked in tact, he more than made up for in intellectual brilliance, wide-ranging vision, and stubborn advocacy. A professor of philosophy, celebrated for his work on Immanuel Kant, Silber was a humanist in the tradition of Jefferson, Holmes, Whitehead, and Barzun.<br><br>The best of the man is revealed in this selection of his writing, speeches, essays, and articles, collected from over forty years of vigorous engagement. Here he speaks as a philosopher, educator, parent, and political observer and participant (ahead in the polls, he would have been elected Governor of Massachusetts had he not run afoul of Channel Five's beloved Natalie Jacobsen. The famous incident is recounted in high style in Tom Wolfe's Foreword). Silber tackles issues including education at all levels, culture and the media, democracy and international affairs. Delivered from 1971 to 2012, the speeches offer his incisive reflections on the Vietnam War, Watergate, student activism of the seventies, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, developments in science and technology, the increasing power of the media, global corporations, and many other issues. His style is lively, crisp, and pointed, spiked with his acerbic wit and guided by an ongoing search for wisdom.<br><br>Silber was a model of probity and integrity in both his private and his public life, an intellectual pessimist and a congenital optimist. Even as he brought Boston University from a sleepy and fast-declining "streetcar college" to a major educational institution, he spoke out on topical issues and principles on which our human fulfillment and national identity depended. Inspiring many, infuriating some, his was a life that mattered, and a voice worth listening to.</p><p>John Robert Silber was born in San Antonio in 1926. The seventh president of Boston University, he was, in addition, the first chairman of the Texas Society to Abolish Capital Punishment, a leader in the racial integration of the University of Texas, a member of the founding committee of Project Head Start, a member of President Reagan s Bipartisan Committee on Central America, the 1990 Democratic nominee for Governor of Massachusetts, and Chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Education. His books include Straight Shooting: What s Wrong with America and How to Fix It, Architecture of the Absurd: How Genius Disfigured a Practical Art, and Kant s Ethics.

Structuralism constituted an intellectual revolution in the 1960s and 1970s and radically transformed the way philosophy, political and social theory, history, science, and aesthetics were discussed and thought about. For Marx was a key contribution to that process and it fundamentally recast the way in which many people understood Marx and Marxism.<br><br>This book contains the classic statements of Althusser&#x2019;s analysis of the young Marx and the importance of Feuerbach during this formative period, of his thesis of the &#x201c;epistomological break&#x201d; between the early and the late Marx, and of his conception of dialectics, contradiction and &#x201c;overdetermination.&#x201d; Also included is a study of the materialist theater of Bertolazzi and Brecht and the critique of humanist readings of Marxism. Since his death in 1990, Althusser&#x2019;s legacy has come under renewed examination and it is increasingly recognized that the influence of his ideas has been wider and deeper than previously thought: reading For Marx, in its audacity, originality and rigor, will explain why this impact was so significant.</p><p><b>Louis Althusser</b> was born in Algeria in 1918 and died in France in 1990. He taught philosophy for many years at the Ecole Normale Superieur in Paris, and was a leading intellectual in the French Communist Party. His books include <i>For Marx</i>; <i>Reading Capital</i> (with Etienne Balibar); <i>Essays in Ideology</i>; <i>Politics and History: Montesquieu, Rousseau, Marx</i>; <i>Machiavelli and Us</i>; and <i>The Spectre of Hegel</i>.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Ghost Force</h2><p><blockquote><p>The year is 2011.</p><p>An oil-hungry world is starving . . .</p></blockquote><p>. . . and Argentina, with Russia's help, is determined to brutally wrest the petroleum-rich Falkland Islands from British hands.

He divides his time between Ireland and Cape Cod.</p>Erik Steele has his work cut out for him narrating this jumble of a story that could more rightly be called "Falkland Islands War II." Instead it's entitled GHOST FORCE� in reference to the shadowy presence of Russia in manipulating Argentina and England into going to war. Erik Steele beautifully interprets numerous accents, from huffing Russian generals to stuffy British politicians and fervent Argentineans. However, his Australian political advisor sounds off the mark; Steele plays him way too young and sounding far too much like Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin. Ultimately, the story falls short. It's too much hot lead and derring-do and not enough careful plotting. Listen if you like action sagas and are not troubled by inconsistencies and unnecessary plot twists.

Barbara McClintock (1902-1992), a geneticist who integrated classical genetics with microscopic observations of the behavior of chromosomes, was regarded as a genius and as an unorthodox, nearly incomprehensible thinker. In 1946, she discovered mobile genetic elements, which she called "controlling elements." Thirty-seven years later, she won a Nobel Prize for this work, becoming the third woman to receive an unshared Nobel in science. Since then, McClintock has become an emblem of feminine scientific thinking and the tragedy of narrow-mindedness and bias in science. </p><p> Using McClintock's research notes, newly available correspondence, and dozens of interviews with McClintock and others, Comfort argues that McClintock's work was neither ignored in the 1950s nor wholly accepted two decades later. Nor was McClintock marginalized by scientists; throughout the decades of her alleged rejection, she remained a distinguished figure in her field. Comfort replaces the "McClintock myth" with a new story, rich with implications for our understanding of women in science and scientific creativity. </p></p><p>Nathaniel C. Comfort is Deputy Director, Center for History of Recent Science, George Washington University.Barbara McClintock received the Nobel prize in 1983 at age 81 for her work in corn genetics. Evelyn Fox Keller's biography of McClintock, A Feeling for the Organism, was published that same year. This current study by the deputy director of the Center for History of Recent Science, George Washington University, argues that Keller's description of McClintock's milieu and, indeed, McClintock's own description of her role in scientific society were often at odds with reality. Comfort suggests that rather than being a loner and maverick who served as a target of bias and narrow-mindedness, McClintock was always well respected and remained a distinguished figure in the scientific community until her death in 1992. The author develops several themes to explain McClintock's life, among them her need for independence and control over her own work. He also goes to great pains to explain the significance of her work at each stage. What he does not demonstrate is whether there really was substantial understanding of her work at the time that it was done. Certainly, after major development in related fields such as molecular biology, her early ideas were more appreciated. Regardless, this is an interesting work that provides insight into McClintock's work and personality. For academic libraries. Hilary D.

It was an early morning flight out of Bogot� to Cali, Colombia, and he was a reluctant traveler. Besides the inconvenient hour, the forty-one-year-old businessman really could not afford to take time away from his latest venture, a small refinery he was developing to reprocess used motor oil. The project was behind schedule, and here he was flying off on a mystery trip. He had no idea why he was going to Cali. In fact, until arriving at Bogot�'s El Dorado International Airport an hour earlier, he didn't even know his destination.<br><br>"Jorge, you need to come with me. Some people want to meet you," his friend Mario had said on the phone. He was emphatic. He told Jorge to pack an overnight bag-then hung up. Now they were on the plane together.<br><br>"What's the deal, Mario?" Jorge couldn't hide a tone of impatience as he turned to his friend settling into the aisle seat. "What are we doing here?"<br><br>Like Jorge, Mario was in his early forties-fit, trim, and exuding confidence. Even in casual civilian clothes, he looked military, like someone out of Central Casting. But the recently retired major Mario del Basto was the real thing, a highly decorated soldier.<br><br>"After takeoff," he assured Jorge, "we'll talk." He gave a nod toward strangers still standing in the aisle.<br><br>Jorge had always trusted Mario. The two had been good friends since soon after Jorge joined the Colombian army reserves in 1984. Mario, an officer in the regular army, became commanding officer of Jorge's Cali- based reserve unit. The major relied on Jorge as an intelligence officer with valuable skills in weaponry, electronic surveillance, radio technologies, and photography.<br><br>The army reserve was an unpaid, volunteer position, but it gave Jorge the taste of a military career like that of his father, General Jorge Salcedo. The senior Salcedo had been a contender for chief of Colombia's armed forces, and he remained a prominent public figure nearly twenty-five years after his retirement in the mid-1960s.<br><br>Jorge saw reflections of his father in Major del Basto. Both were career army officers. Both wore uniforms with chests full of medals for valor. Both had extensive experience fighting antigovernment guerrillas.<br><br>Growing up the son of a general provided Jorge with many advantages, from financial security and social respect to opportunities for travel- including an extended stay in the United States while his father was on assignment in Kansas. It also influenced his views on groups like FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), against whom his father waged war. At home and in the reserves, Jorge saw the guerrillas as irredeemable terrorists, and he came to share frustrations widely held in the military that government-sanctioned peace talks simply allowed guerrillas to regroup and resupply.<br><br>"We're trying to talk them to death," Mario complained to Jorge.<br><br>Even for a military hero like Major del Basto, such criticism of the civilian leadership was dangerous. He shared his opinions only with close friends until his rage could be contained no longer. At the close of 1988, del Basto rejected a promotion to colonel and quit the army. He blasted President Virgilio Barco for coddling FARC. Then he disappeared. Jorge hadn't heard from Mario for days-not until the mysterious phone call that led him aboard this Avianca airlines flight.<br><br>"We're going to see some Cali guys," Mario began moments after they were airborne. He was leaning across the empty middle seat between them. Engine noise protected their privacy.<br><br>"Do I know them?"<br><br>"It's possible. They're important local businessmen."<br><br>Jorge had lived in Cali as a boy, when his father was the army brigade commander there. Again in the early 1980s, he resided there while working as a partner and engineer at a battery-manufacturing plant just outside Colombia's third-largest city.<br><br>"What I can tell you," Mario went on, "is that these people have a serious problem with Pablo Escobar. He's bombing their businesses, threatening their families-it's a terrible situation."<br><br>Jorge's expression abruptly hardened to a glare. "Don't tell me-we're going to see the Cali cartel guys?"<br><br>By January 1989, everyone in Colombia knew about the raging feud between Escobar's Medell�n cartel and his rivals in Cali. For nearly a year, headlines carried gruesome accounts of bombings, dismemberments, and shootings. The number of innocent-bystander deaths mounted. Like most of his friends and cohorts, Jorge feared and loathed Pablo Escobar. The drug boss had declared war on the Colombian government in a campaign to overturn Bogot�'s extradition treaty with Washington. His paid assassins targeted national officials, local police, criminal investigators, and judges. A Medell�n hit team struck especially close to home when it gunned down one of Jorge's boyhood friends, a popular minister of justice named Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.<br><br>Jorge didn't know much about Escobar's rivals in Cali, except by reputation. They were regarded as less violent-at least they did not kill public figures. In fact, the southern bosses were widely known as "the Gentlemen of Cali." Nonetheless, Jorge never considered taking sides. The war between the cartels was none of his business.<br><br>"You should have told me," Jorge said. "Maybe I don't want to meet them."<br><br>Mario shrugged. "But they want to meet you."<br><br>Jorge shook his head in wonder. A big organized crime outfit wanted to see him. Why? Mario looked around to see that no one was listening and continued.<br><br>Soon after leaving the army, Mario said, he had been called to Cali and offered a position managing security for the Rodr�guez Orejuela family. Jorge recognized the name. They were owners of a national chain of discount pharmacies and a professional soccer team, among many other legitimate interests. But it was common knowledge that they were also big-time traffickers. Like Escobar, they denied any drug ties. Unlike Escobar, they kept a low profile.<br><br>"These guys are afraid for their lives and for their families," Mario said. "Pablo is trying to kill them-men, women, children, everyone." He said it was especially unfair to the Rodr�guez Orejuela clan because "they are not violent people." Mario described his new job as keeping innocent women and children safe from Escobar's hired killers.<br><br>"And they think you can help, too."<br><br>"So, it's not the cartel drug business," Jorge said with obvious relief.<br><br>"No, of course not." Mario dropped his voice so that even Jorge could barely hear him: "But don't talk about cartels. They hate the word. There is no Cali cartel, you understand? They're businessmen."<br><br>"I see. All right, but-why me?"<br><br>Jorge considered himself a businessman who recycled motor oil and an engineer who designed manufacturing systems or tinkered with cameras and radios. In the army reserves he specialized in surveillance and intelligence, a relatively new area of personal interest. Still, he saw no obvious reasons for a summons to Cali.<br><br>He asked again: "Why?"<br><br>Mario smiled, sat back, and said nothing.<br><br>***<br><br>Jorge wasn't looking for a job that morning in January. He already had business deals brewing on several fronts-including potentially lucrative negotiations with the Colombian military. Jorge had recently begun representing some European companies interested in landing defense contracts in Colombia and other Latin American countries, clients he picked up during the previous year while attending an international exhibition of military suppliers in London. He returned with samples of night-vision gear, encrypted radios, and surveillance devices he hoped to sell to army procurement officials in Bogot�.<br><br>But what most intrigued one of the Bogot� generals was the business card of David Tomkins, a colorful arms dealer based near London. Tomkins and a group of retired British special forces soldiers offered to instruct the Colombian army in guerrilla-fighting techniques. Jorge relayed their proposal.<br><br>"These trainers, they are also mercenaries?" asked the general. He had once served as an aide to Jorge's father. He knew he could trust the old general's son. "Would your contacts consider a clandestine mission against the FARC?"<br><br>Within a few days, Jorge was flying back to England. There, he presented Tomkins with a proposed assignment: attack and destroy FARC's showcase mountain headquarters known as Casa Verde. The Colombian military would secretly support the raid-providing arms, explosives, and transportation-but it had to be done in such a way that the army could deny involvement.<br><br>The British mercenaries had flexible ideologies that could accommodate a wide array of customers, but they tended to be staunchly anticommunist. To clinch the deal, Jorge pointed out FARC's long- standing support from Fidel Castro. The Brits eagerly signed on. Their field leader was a Scotsman named Peter McAleese, a tough former Special Air Service (SAS) sergeant and paratrooper who once survived a jump with a failed parachute.<br><br>FARC had many enemies. Guerrilla bands had attacked remote villages, seized farmers, miners, and ranchers for ransom, and even dared to kidnap drug traffickers. When the British commandos arrived in Colombia, they were welcomed by an unlikely alliance of rich cattlemen, miners, and leaders of the Medell�n cocaine cartel. Primary funding for the mission came from Jos� Rodr�guez-Gacha, a major landowner and a trafficking partner of Pablo Escobar's. With dissident military officials providing arms and munitions, the Brits were backed by a Faustian ensemble-what Colombians called la mesa del Diablo . . . "the Devil's table." And Jorge served as ma�tre d'.<br><br>Through the summer of 1988, Jorge-code-named Richard-was the secret liaison between the commandos and their Colombian supporters. If the mission were exposed, the army would disavow any knowledge. Jorge was responsible for keeping the Brits fed, housed, supplied, and out of public view. One of the few with whom he shared details of the operation was Mario del Basto. Jorge took him to jungle training sites and introduced the major to Tomkins and McAleese.<br><br>Preparations for the attack dragged on for months. The Brits were ready, but the dissident military officers hesitated. They were fearful of a political backlash and ultimately unwilling to risk their military careers. In the end, the same cabal of military officials who had launched the secret plan called it off.<br><br>Nonetheless, the commandos left happy and well paid, thanks to the wealthy Medell�n ranchers and traffickers who reimbursed the Brits for training ragtag elements of their private armies. One drug boss had even sent his son for jungle combat training. In November 1988, Tomkins and McAleese were the last to fly home. In a farewell meeting with Jorge, they embraced and said they were eager for future assignments. "Until next time," McAleese said.<br><br>Jorge immediately returned to his neglected business interests, but now-eight weeks later-he was flying to Cali and wondering why.<br><br>A car from the InterContinental hotel was waiting for them at Cali's Alfonso Bonilla Arag�n International Airport. Luxury hotel suites were also waiting, stocked with fresh fruits and flowers-compliments of the Rodr�guez Orejuela family. A message said that their afternoon appointment with "the gentlemen" was delayed. A car would pick them up around ten o'clock that night.<br><br>The timing was not coincidental. In light nighttime traffic, anyone trying to follow the car would be more easily detected. Jorge knew Cali well and realized immediately that they were doubling back, circling, and watching to be sure that no one was tailing them. Jorge felt his first twinge of anxiety. Since childhood, he had been prone to mild attacks of claustrophobia. In the backseat of the Cali cartel car, his throat tightened. He took a deep breath and wiped a sweaty palm on his slacks. He didn't want Mario to notice. But he also couldn't help feeling that his friend had put him in a difficult spot.<br><br>The winding drive finally ended at a high-walled compound. Their car entered through a large gate that shut behind them. Jorge glanced around as he stepped out. He saw security lapses everywhere. Dozens of bodyguards milled about, bristling with firearms, but they seemed most intent on swatting mosquitoes. No one inspected the car. Curiously to Jorge, all sentries were inside the walls. He saw no one posted outside.<br><br>Even in the dark, Jorge could see that the auto court was full of cars- mostly Mazda sedans and midsized SUVs-parked at haphazard angles. A handful of smaller cars effectively blocked all the others. In an emergency, all but a few would be trapped.<br><br>A cartel security man greeted them just outside the door to the main house. Jos� Estrada was about forty, a retired army sergeant. He escorted Jorge and Mario through a seemingly empty house. The floors were polished white marble. The white walls and ceilings were freshly painted. The furniture was luxurious white leather. Jorge saw no books, no toys, no children, none of the clutter of family life. It looked like a showcase for interior designers or a furniture showroom. The style gave Jorge his first clue to the manners and tastes of the drug lords: practical, efficient, and businesslike.<br><br>The visitors were ushered into a spacious office where four men were waiting. So, these were the Cali cartel godfathers, Jorge thought-men who could play God with human lives, dictate government policies, and influence the national economy. They were not particularly imposing physically. At nearly six feet two, Jorge was taller than anyone in the room. As Mario made the introductions, Jorge greeted each boss with a smile and a handshake. They seemed pleased to meet him-and completely harmless, almost benign.<br><br>Pacho Herrera, thirty-seven, was the youngest of the four. This was one of his houses-his white palette, his sterile rooms. He looked as if he had just stepped off the pages of a gentleman's fashion magazine. Pacho was the only unmarried godfather. He was homosexual. Jorge thought that Pacho had the empathetic, easygoing manner of a young priest. What he didn't know was that the gay gangster ran the most brutal wing of enforcers in the cartel.<br><br>Chepe Santacruz, forty-five, was in denim and cotton and looked the part of a farmer or rancher who had just come in from the stables. He seemed jovial and self-deprecating, even a bit mischievous. But he sometimes took his penchant for teasing too far. His rough edges showed in the coarseness of his conversation. Chepe was proudly unsophisticated. He also was a street fighter.

Now she turns her attention to girls: the biological and cultural milestones for girls today, and how they shape a girl's sense of herself.<br><br>The transition from girl to woman is an experience that has changed radically over the generations: everything from how a girl learns about her period to how she expects to be treated by boys and men. Girls today observe these passages very differently, and yet the landmarks themselves have remained remarkably constant-proof, Flanagan believes, of their significance. In a world where protections of girls' privacy and personal freedom seem to disappear every day, the ultimate challenge modern parents face is finding a way to defend both.</p><p>Caitlin Flanagan is a former high school teacher who became a writer; she has been on staff at <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, and the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.

The Psychology of Hate is a groundbreaking book that brings together experts on the psychology of hate to present their diverse viewpoints in a single volume. The contributors address a set of questions that include: How do you conceptualize hate and what evidence is there for this conceptualization? What do you see as the role of hate in terrorism, massacres, and genocides? How can hate be assessed? The volume additionally provides concrete suggestions for how to combat hate, and attempts to understand the minds both of those who hate and those who are hated.</p><p>Robert J.

According to one research program, anxiety-related issues are the number one mental health problem among women and are second only to alcohol and drug abuse among men. Stress-related ailments cost the nation $300 billion every year in medical bills and lost productivity. And use of sedative drugs like Xanax and Valium have skyrocketed in the last 15 years. Even students are feeling it. One psychologist reports that the average high school kid today has the same level of anxiety as the average psychiatric patient in the early 1950s.

And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.In the characteristic tone of his previous books like You&#39;ll Get Through This and Fearless, Max guides readers through this Scripture passage and explains the key concepts of celebration, asking for help, leaving our concerns, and meditating.Stop letting anxiety rule the day. Join Max on the journey to true freedom and experience more joy, clarity, physical renewal, and contentment by the power of the Holy Spirit. Anxiety comes with life.

Although Russian to the soles of his feet, he was happy only when living abroad. For decades he passionately pursued a stoop-shouldered soprano who responded only with kind words. He drew close to Tsar-hating conspirators, mistrusted revolution and was scorned by conservatives and leftists alike. This engrossing, brisk biography by the French biographer of Tolstoy, Gogol and Chekhov offers no major personal revelations or stunning literary insights. Troyat's achievement in this down-to-earth, concise narrative is to take the measure of a sensitive man torn between literature and love, between Slavophile longings and an attraction to Western liberal ways. There are unforgettable scenes: Turgenev showing Tolstoy how the can-can is danced in Paris; young Ivan, a dandified student in Germany, watched over by a male secretary who is actually his bastard half-brother; Dostoyevsky goading the rootless aristocrat into a towering rage. Troyat seamlessly interweaves Turgenev's letters and journal entries to pin down his enigmatic subject.

I&#x2019;d say it is when your heart is pounding and you&#x2019;re out of breath. Hunters and competitive shooters both know this feeling. It occurs when you have to sprint to your next shooting position in a match or when you need to make the final push to the ridge of the mountain at last light. With your lungs working like a bellows and your heart pounding for all it&#x2019;s worth, do what biathletes do to settle down before shooting.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>STEP 1</b> Take three deep, controlled breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. This will lower your heart rate and steady your aim.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>STEP 2</b> As you get ready to shoot, let the air out of your lungs, pausing at the bottom of your breathing cycle. In this relaxed state, you have about 7 seconds to fire before the lack of oxygen affects your vision and induces muscle tremors.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>STEP 3</b> If you can&#x2019;t manage the shot in this time, don&#x2019;t force it&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll only miss.

The history she&#x2019;d ignored while growing up became a source of comfort and inspiration, and narrowed the gap separating her&#x2015;an independent, Chinese-American woman&#x2015;from her Old World Chinese parents.<br><br> In <em>Forget Sorrow</em>, Yang makes her debut into the graphic form with the story of her father&#x2019;s family, reunited under the House of Yang in Manchuria during the Second World War and struggling&#x2015;both together and individually&#x2015;to weather poverty, famine, and, later, Communist oppression. The parallels between Belle Yang&#x2019;s journey of self-discovery and the lives and choices of her grandfather, his brothers, and their father (the Patriarch) speak powerfully of the conflicts between generations&#x2015;and of possibilities for reconciliation.<br><br> Forget Sorrow demonstrates the power of storytelling and remembrance, as Belle&#x2015;in telling this story&#x2015;finds the strength to honor both her father and herself.</p><p>Belle Yang is the author of the popular illustrated books Hannah Is My Name, The Odyssey of a Manchurian, and Baba: A Return to China Upon My Father&#x2019;s Shoulders.

This is the path of conscious love.</p><p>PRAISE FOR JOURNEY OF THE HEART <br>This is an extraordinarily good book, because it goes to the heart of the matter of human relationships. In a world in which so many live in crowded solitude, and are afraid of intimacy or have difficulty understanding it, John Welwood's <i>Journey of the Heart</i> comes as a saving grace. I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't greatly benefit from experiencing it, for it is a rare, enriching, and exhilarating experience. (Ashley Montagu, author of Touching). <p><i>Journey of the Heart</i> is a profound and wonderful book. It is a spiritual text on intimate relationship that is grounded in real life, and an inspiration for anyone who believes that a committed relationship can be a process through which two individuals grow." (Jean Shinoda Bolen, author of Goddesses in Everywoman, Gods in Everyman), I am impressed with John Welwood's thinking about critical issues in relationships and his attempt to ground relationship issues in a larger, transpersonal framework. I agree with his view that difficulties provide us with opportunities to grow, to expand our sense of self, and to connect with others in deeper ways. I enjoyed and appreciated that he sees relationships in the larger context of reality and attempts to ground the ordinary in the transcendent realm. What makes this book helpful is that he offers practical processes which can be used to help persons in conflicted relationships... He offers a conceptual and practical pathway from the ordinary experience of everyday conflicts and issues to spiritual evolution. I heartily endorse his efforts. (Harville Hendrix, author of Getting the Love You Want). </p><p>A fabulous book, a deep and profound and caring book, from the Heart, and about the Heart. Required reading for anybody interested in true relationship. Highly recommended! (Ken Wilber, author of A Brief History of Everything). </p><p>John Welwood's <i>Journey of the Heart</i> is a very timely and helpful book that shows how both women and men benefit from relations based on partnership rather than domination. (Riane Eisler, author of The Chalice and the Blade). </p><p>This book teaches one how to take up an inner position from which one can begin to work on one's most intractable feelings in relation to another person-- so that they become a path of self-development for both individuals. (Eugene Gendlin, author of Focusing). </p><p>INSIDE FLAP: <i>Journey of the Heart</i> offers a new approach to intimate relationships-- as a path, an unfolding process of personal and spiritual discovery whose challenges awaken our deepest strengths and resources. </p><p>As men and women find that they can no longer rely on old roles and formulas to get along, intimate relationship calls for a new kind of honesty and awareness, a willingness to let go of old patterns and cultivate new powers and sensitivities. </p><p><i>Journey of the Heart</i> shows how we can meet this challenge by learning to use whatever difficulties we are facing in relationships as opportunities to expand our sense of who we are and deepen our capacity to connect with others. By inviting us to bring together life's basic polarities-- male and female, individuality and commitment, love and fear-- relationships teach us to move gracefully with life's mystery and unpredictability. When we appreciate our relationships in this way-- as teachers-- they become both a personal path that refines and transforms us as individuals and a sacred one as well, allowing us to tap into the larger powers of life. </p><p><i>Journey of the Heart</i> takes a sweeping and penetrating look at the most challenging areas of relationship-- passion, vulnerability, need, commitment, disillusion and heartbreak, conflict and communication, male/female differences, sexuality, and marriage-- to show how the greatest difficulties also provide the greatest opportunities for growth, new awareness, and a deeper connection with ourselves, with others, and with life itself.</p>John Welwood is a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist.

Enhanced by the author&#x2019;s delightful drawings, it is perfect for Valentine&#x2019;s Day, and any other occasion that demands a special, out-of-the-ordinary gift.</p><p><p>MARGARET ATWOOD&#x2019;s books have been published in more than thirty-five countries.

Maybe we just want to be in charge, of the life, no matter who lived it.<br><br>It helps if there are photos. No more choices for the people in them &#x2014; pick this one, dump that one. The livers of the lives in question had their chances, most of which they blew. They should have spotted the photographer in the bushes, they �shouldn&#x2019;t have chewed with their mouths open, they �shouldn&#x2019;t have worn the strapless top, they �shouldn&#x2019;t have yawned, they �shouldn&#x2019;t have laughed: so unattractive, the candid denture. <i>So that&#x2019;s what she looked like</i>, we say, connecting the snapshot to the year of the torrid affair. <i>Face like a half-�eaten pizza, and is that him, gaping down her front?

I �don&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m putting it together; no, I&#x2019;m taking it apart. It&#x2019;s mostly a question of editing. If you&#x2019;d wanted the narrative line you should have asked earlier, when I still knew everything and was more than willing to tell. That was before I discovered the virtues of scissors, the virtues of matches.<br><i><br>I was born</i>, I would have begun, once. But snip, snip, away go mother and father, white ribbons of paper blown by the wind, with grandparents tossed out for good measure. <i>I spent my childhood</i>. Enough of that as well. Goodbye dirty little dresses, goodbye scuffed shoes that caused me such anguish, goodbye well-�thumbed tears and scabby knees, and sadness worn at the edges.<br><br>Adolescence can be discarded too, with its salty tanned skin, its fecklessness and bad romance and leakages of seasonal blood.

Farewell crumbling turrets of historic interest, farewell icebergs and war monuments, all those young stone men with eyes upturned, and risky voyages teeming with germs, and dubious hotels, and doorways opening both in and out. Farewell friends and lovers, you&#x2019;ve slipped from view, erased, defaced: I know you once had hairdos and told jokes, but I �can&#x2019;t recall them.

In 1879, having written <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i>, the 51 year-old Tolstoy began to believe that his life was meaningless. <i>Confession</i> is his account of the limited satisfactions he derived from his aesthetic and intellectual triumphs, and of his first yearnings for real faith. This book marks the turning point in his career as a writer: after 1880 he would write almost exclusively about religious life, especially devotion among the peasantry (in works such as <i>The Death of Ivan Ilych</i> and <i>Resurrection</i>). Near the end of <i>Confession</i>, Tolstoy describes the desolation he felt upon deciding that he could not solve his crisis of faith by taking refuge in the church. "I have no doubt that there is truth in the doctrine," he writes, "but there can also be no doubt that it harbors a lie; and I must find the truth and the lie so I can tell them apart." <i>Confession</i> does not find the full Truth, but it offers an inspiring example of a man rejecting the lies that cling to unthinking orthodoxy. Its final, exhilarating, heart-rending account of a spiritually awakening dream ranks with the best of Christian mystical writing. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>An account of a spiritual crisis, marking a shift of Tolstoy&#39;s central focus from the aesthetic to the religious and philosophical.</p><h2>Salvador</h2><p>The author recounts her 1982 visit to El Salvador and describes the terror, fear and political repression that permeated the country</p><p>In 1982, Didion traveled to El Salvador at the height of the ghastly civil war.

The book is ordered chronologically and divided thematically. Each of the 100 sections focuses on one book that represents a particular development in the evolution of books and in turn, world history and society. Abundant photographs inform and embellish. </p><p> Here are some of the themes discussed: </p><ul> <p></p><p> </p><li> In the Beginning -- first human scratches on cave walls, cuneiform tablets, papyrus books, the oldest table of prime numbers </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> Eastern Approaches -- 1,000 years before Europe, the Far East "publishes" books using paper and other writing surfaces in multiple -- in one case 11,000 -- volumes </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> The Great Classics -- the emergence of <i>Aesop's Fables</i> over 2,000 years ago; the first cookbook, by Apicius, reveals the excesses of the Roman empire </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> Medieval Worlds and the Book -- the illuminated <i>Book of Kells</i> survives Viking raids; Ptolemy puts the world on a map; the miraculous beauty of the Prayer Books and Books of Hours </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> Light From the East -- the oldest printed book of all: <i>Diamond Sutra</i>; the first novel, <i>Tale of Genji</i> (written by a woman no less); the first book of astronomy and the first book of anatomy </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> Wheels of Change -- a period of firsts: Gutenberg invents moveable type; the first blockbuster; the first joke book; the first printing in Africa; printing in Arabic; first printed music </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> Print and Steam -- technology puts photography in books; newspapers publish fiction in installments; enter Baedecker, the archetypical travel guide; celebrity cooking hits the page </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> The Book in the Turbulent 20th Century -- public libraries spark an information explosion; the advent of mechanized copying; revolutionary book design; no topic is off limits; the publishing industry </li> <p></p><p> </p><li> Digitization and the Future of the Book -- e-book publishing intersects with a return to handcrafted books; manga, redefining the book. </li> </ul><p></p><p> This book takes a singular approach that will appeal to astute readers. It will have a wide and diverse readership. </p></p><p><p> Roderick Cave is a print historian and librarian who has worked with rare book collections and developed information science courses in libraries and universities around the world. He is the author of <i>Impressions of Nature: A History of Nature Printing</i>. </p><p> Sara Ayad has spent a lifetime with books, and all her working life 'in the business': as reader, library assistant, bookseller, editor and latterly picture researcher, integrating her keen interest in both the literary and visual arts. </p><p> Introduction </p><p> In a time when talk about the death of the book is now trite, there are good reasons to look backwards at what books have been in the past, as well as at the many speculations about the future of written communication. Some journalists and librarians as well as computer enthusiasts believe that the coming of the e-book marks a total and complete revolution. They anticipate an imminent future of publishing that will be entirely electronic. Despite the continuing failure of the paperless office (so confidently predicted 20 years ago) to appear, they expect no paper, no printing; all information being accessed from images on a screen. </p><p> Perhaps the popularity of e-books is rising; perhaps the printed-paper book will disappear (just as the clay tablets of Babylon and the papyrus scrolls of ancient Egypt have long since dropped out of use). We are by no means persuaded that the future form of the book will be entirely electronic; what is certain is that, over the past 10,000 plus years of humankind's history, we have developed ways of preserving and transmitting information which are deeply embedded in our subconsciousness. </p><p> Our emotional connection to physical books will be clear from our selection. We have decided, reluctantly, not to include bookbinding or any consideration of newspapers and magazine publications in this book, important though they are. If we took a chronological approach, it would allow only one picture for every century, so we have had to be very selective in our choice of the books to illustrate. One or two books to represent drama? One for invention? How many for banned books? Choosing our 100 took a lot of thought and debate with people advising us. </p><p> We have not attempted to produce a collection of the 100 best books (however best may be defined). Nor the 100 earliest in this or that way. Nor the most famous, the most beautiful, the most influential or the most valuable; though these all have had an effect on our selection. Nor the most obvious, though it was hard to avoid selecting the earliest examples of printing in Asia and in Europe, and some other books. </p><p> Our principal in selecting books has been to range widely, with books from every continent except Antarctica. Books that illustrate the huge range of formats and styles, with books of string (khipu), or written on bone, bark or palm leaves as well as the better known clay tablets, papyrus scrolls and vellum or paper more familiar in Europe or North America. We have tried to select books that are characteristic of particular genres, but not necessarily the most obvious choice. </p><p> As the pictures in this volume show, we have passed over some books so well known that they needed no further publicity (no King James Bible, no Shakespeare). Instead, we are illustrating several other books equally important or influential in their milieu. Instead of the King James Bible, we include the Gustav Vasa Bible (so important for the spread of Lutheranism in the North, the formation of the modern Swedish language, and the spread of Germanic typography) to stand for all national Bibles. </p><p> It has been said that if you want to understand a particular area or period, you should not look only at the Great and the Good: you will learn much more from looking at the less great and the not very good. This volume has a mix of these, which are intended to stimulate readers' interest enough for them to go further. </p><p> In a period when more "real" printed books are being published, and it is becoming steadily easier to selfpublish, is the day of the printed book over? Our answer has to be found! </p><p> What is certain is that there will be more new developments, sometimes very different from (and better than) the e-books to be published. But even in the 21st century, as our illustrations show, some people are creating new forms of the written or printed book, using methods that may seem deliberately backward-looking and wayward, and ignoring digitization altogether. The traditional book will still be produced for a very long time yet. </p><p> Roderick Cave and Sara Ayad </p></p><h2>Ripped: T-Shirts from the Underground</h2><p>A visual history of counterculture music T-shirts, spanning the defining era of indie music. Ripped is the first book to document the shirts of the post-punk and indie period, after the submission of 1960s rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll to mass popularity and before the onset of ironic consumerism. Carefully selected from the archives of vintage fashion collector Cesar Padilla, the 200 T-shirts in this book are classic examples of rare and extremely limited shirts created by and for the very bands who embodied the true essence of the DIY and indie movements&#x2014;from The Ramones to Sonic Youth, John Cale, Talking Heads, Madonna, X, Pil, The Germs, and many others. Each shirt has been photographed in all its gritty, sweat-stained glory just as it was found&#x2014;on the street, in a thrift store, or inherited from a friend. Introduced by Lydia Lunch, the book includes recollections and ruminations from musicians, fashion designers, and pop culture personalities on the enigmatic and enduring appeal of the rock band T-shirt.</p><p><b>Cesar Padilla</b> has owned Cherry&#x2014;rated among the top ten vintage boutiques in the world by <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar</i>, <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Elle</i>&#x2014;since 1997.

But this is much more than a book about gardening. Michael Pollan masterfully promotes the garden as the most appropriate site to rethink our relationship to nature and to begin to put it on a saner footing. One of the best reasons to garden today, Pollan believes, is to put yourself on intimate terms with one samall corner of the universe.</p><p>Eight years ago, <i>Harper's Magazine</i> editor Michael Pollan bought an old Connecticut dairy farm. He planted a garden and attempted to follow Thoreau's example: do not impose your will upon the wilderness, the woodchucks, or the weeds. That ethic did not, of course, work. But neither did pesticides or firebombing the woodchuck burrow. So Michael Pollan began to think about the troubled borders between nature and contemporary life.<br><br>The result is a funny, profound, and beautifully written book in the finest tradition of American nature writing. It inspires thoughts on the war of the roses; sex and class conflict in the garden; virtuous composting; the American lawn; seed catalogs, and the politics of planting a tree. A blend of meditation, autobiography, and social history, <b>Second Nature</b> is ultimately a modern <b>Walden</b>: a true classic for our time.Michael Pollan is the author of The Botany of Desire, The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma and In Defense of Food, all New York Times bestsellers. A longtime contributor to The New York Times Magazine, he is also the Knight Professor of Journalism at Berkeley.</p><h2>Seize the Day</h2><p><b>&#x201c;What makes all of this so remarkable is not merely Bellow&#x2019;s eye and ear for vital detail.

In 1976 Bellow was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature "for the human understanding and subtle analysis of contemporary culture that are combined in his work."''It is the special distinction of Mr. Bellow as a novelist that he is able to give us, step by step, the world we really live each day--and in the same movement to show us that the real suffering of not understanding, the deprivation of light.

As Dr. Kent Kiehl shows, psychopaths can be identified by a checklist of symptoms that includes pathological lying; lack of empathy, guilt, and remorse; grandiose sense of self-worth; manipulation; and failure to accept one&#x2019;s actions. But why do psychopaths behave the way they do? Is it the result of their environment&#x2014; how they were raised&#x2014;or is there a genetic compo�nent to their lack of conscience? <br><br> This is the question Kiehl, a prot�g� of famed psychopath researcher Dr. Robert Hare, was deter�mined to answer as he began his career twenty years ago. To aid in his quest to unravel the psy�chopathic mind, Kiehl created the first mobile functional MRI scanner to study psychopaths in prison populations. The brains of more than five hundred psychopaths and three thousand other offenders have been scanned by Kiehl&#x2019;s labora�tory&#x2014;the world&#x2019;s largest forensic neuroscience repository of its kind. Over the course of <i>The Psy�chopath Whisperer</i>, we follow the scientific bread crumbs that Kiehl uncovered to show that the key brain structures that correspond with emotional engagement and reactions are diminished in psy�chopaths, offering new clues to how to predict and treat the disorder. <br><br> In <i>The Psychopath Whisperer</i>, Kiehl describes in fascinating detail his years working with psy�chopaths and studying their thought processes&#x2014; from the remorseless serial killers he meets with behind bars to children whose behavior and per�sonality traits exhibit the early warning signs of psychopathy. <br><br> Less than 1 percent of the general population meets the criteria for psychopathy. But psycho�paths account for a vastly outsized proportion of violent crimes. And as Kiehl shows, many who aren&#x2019;t psychopaths exhibit some of the behaviors and traits associated with the condition. What do you do if you discover your roommate, or boss, or the person you are dating has traits that define a psy�chopath? And what does having a diminished limbic region of the brain mean for how the legal system approaches crimes committed by psychopaths? <br><br> A compelling narrative of cutting-edge science, <i>The Psychopath Whisperer </i>will open your eyes on a fascinating but little understood world, with startling implications for society, the law, and our personal lives.</p><p><b>KENT A.

From descriptions of crimes ("The fusillade of bullets tore through Johnson's body.... Blood, bits of flesh and bone fragments exploded everywhere") to hepatitis C "bleed-outs" ("All four walls of the bathroom looked like someone had taken a blood hose and turned it on them"), Reavill grabs the reader by the throat and doesn't let go. He follows the techs from Aftermath, Inc.&#x2014;a bioremediation outfit in suburban Chicago&#x2014;as they make the rounds of shotgun suicides, multiple murders and meth lab cleanups; dealing not only with the gross-out of the work but trying to stay sane doing it. While some black humor seeps in around the edges, Reavill mostly depicts a cadre of low-key, hardworking men doing a horrible job with respect and compassion. The narrative pace flags a bit in the last 50 pages when Reavill tries to connect Aftermath's work with larger moral issues, but otherwise, if anything can get <i>CSI </i>watchers to flip off the tube and pick up a book, this is it.<i> (May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Wheatcroft covers everything from the various outbreaks of European anti-Semitism--including Hitler's Final Solution--to the accomplishments of liberated European Jews, the argument over forming a Jewish state, the countless Jews who immigrated to the United States, and the recent assassination of Yitzak Rabin. Combining factual information with colorful profiles and anecdotes, he examines the suffering, debates, ideas, and victories that have impacted Jewish culture.An eloquent, thorough, and thought-provoking record of that century-old tempest called Zionism. British historian Wheatcroft (The Randlords, 1986) admirably covers one hundred years of political, social, cultural, and personal controversy, from Theodore Herzl to Yigal Amir, providing a superior study of Jewish history. As an objective outsider, the author effectively compares the issues of Jewish nationalism with the Irish question. Only a non-Jewish historian might marvel, as Wheatcroft does, at the depth of Jewish self-deprecation and paranoia that continues to inform the relationship between diaspora Jews and Zionism. ``Each hyphenate [American immigrant group] took an interest in its own people across the sea--and each for that matter was open to the accusation of dual loyalty,'' so ``why should the Jewish Americans feel bashful?'' While Central European Jews spearheaded political Zionism and Eastern European Jews did most of the emigrating, Wheatcroft assigns a pivotal role to American Jews, whose healthier egos and checkbooks made the Zionist experiment possible. The author offers personal glimpses into the key players of the Zionist drama while also providing significant philosophical overviews. We are shown, for instance, how both nationalists (Heine) and universalists (Marx) of the 19th century were too assimilationist to support the Zionist cause. Singleminded militant Zionists like Jabotinsky are contrasted with critics of the movement, like Arendt, Buber, and Einstein, with most representatives of the spectrum of debate placed in the context of their geographic and historical circumstances. While concluding that the Zionist endeavor has been an unprecedented success, Wheatcroft suggests that problems with Israel's Arab and religious Jewish minorities may take up the next hundred years. Like most Jewish historians, Wheatcroft vastly underrates the role of Judaism in Zionism, yet this book offers valuable historical and psychological insights into what it means to be a Zionist or a Jew. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The consequences of that momentous decision, which set in motion a transformation eventually affecting the entire postwar world order, are here chronicled from inside a previously forbidden Soviet city, Magnitogorsk. Built under Stalin and championed by him as a showcase of socialism, the city remained closed to Western scrutiny until four years ago, when Stephen Kotkin became the first American to live there in nearly half a century.<br><br>An uncommonly perceptive observer, a gifted writer, and a first-rate social scientist, Kotkin offers the reader an unsurpassed portrait of daily life in the Gorbachev era. From the formation of "informal" political groups to the start-up of fledgling businesses in the new cooperative sector, from the no-holds-barred investigative reporting of a former Communist party mouthpiece to a freewheeling multicandidate election campaign, the author conveys the texture of contemporary Soviet society in the throes of an upheaval not seen since the 1930s.<br><br>Magnitogorsk, a planned "garden city" in the Ural Mountains, serves as Kotkin's laboratory for observing the revolutionary changes occurring in the Soviet Union today. Dominated by a self-perpetuating Communist party machine, choked by industrial pollution, and haunted by a suppressed past, this once-proud city now faces an uncertain future, as do the more than one thousand other industrial cities throughout the Soviet Union.<br><br>Kotkin made his remarkable first visit in 1987 and returned in 1989. On both occasions, steelworkers and schoolteachers, bus drivers and housewives, intellectuals and former victims of oppression&#x2014;all willingly stepped forward to voice long-suppressed grievances and aspirations. Their words animate this moving narrative, the first to examine the impact and contradictions of <i>perestroika</i> in a single community. Like no other Soviet city, Magnitogorsk provides a window onto the desperate struggle to overcome the heavy burden of Stalin's legacy.</p><p><b>Stephen Kotkin</b> is Assistant Professor of History at Princeton University.Closed to Western observers until the early 1980s, Magnitogorsk, a steel production center built during Stalin's industrialization of the 1930s, embodies much of Communism's ideology as well as the Soviet people's hopes for a better future. While conducting historical research in 1987, Kotkin was allowed to live for two months in that city. In April 1989 he returned for another brief stay. During his two visits he met with various residents, including both members of the party and those opposed to its rule, and he records their commentary on life in the Soviet Union and on the upheavals wracking their country. Often recounted in the residents' own words, these micro-level reviews of perestroika and glasnost reveal a disillusioned people beset by confusion and despair as they confront the challenges of an aging industrial plant, the ravages of pollution, and a moribund economy.

The runaway tortilla begins as a perfect, fluffy, light tortilla made by Tio Jose and Tia Lupe at El Papagayo Feliz (the Happy Parrot) taqueria. When the adorable talking tortilla learns that she is destined to be eaten, she decides to escape her fate by running swiftly away, saying, "Run as fast as fast can be. You won't get a bite of me. Doesn't matter what you do, I'll be far ahead of you." A hilarious chase begins with Tio Jose and Tia Lupe chasing the runaway tortilla into the desert, soon followed by a cavalcade of animals, including seis vaqueros (six cowboys), cinco cascabeles (five rattlesnakes), cuartro conejos (four jackrabbits), tres burros (three burros), y dos sapos cornudos (and two horned toads). The runaway tortilla outruns them all and believes she is safe from being caught and eaten. Then she meets Senor Coyote, her nemesis. Coyote is very sly, using a devious trick to finally catch and eat the delicious, vain little runaway tortilla. All is illustrated in lovely soft desert hues, with comical expressive faces on all characters, animal, human and edible. The interweaving of Spanish terms is seamless in the narrative, inviting children ages 5 and up to enjoy this refreshing Southwestern American version of a beloved classic." ?Children's Bookwatch<br><br>Perfection can be dangerous, as restaurateurs Ta Lupe and To Jos discover when one of their delicious tortillas comes to life and runs away. The handmade tortillas, "light as a cloud and as soft as the fuzz on a baby's cheek," are so gravity-defying that one takes off, pursued at first by the couple, and then by a parade of conejos (rabbits), sapos cornudos (lizards), vaqueros (cowboys), and other locals. The story should sound familiar; it's a Spanish-sprinkled update of "The Gingerbread Man." This tortilla tale is a revamp of Kimmel's out-of-print 2000 book of the same name, illustrated by Randy Cecil, featuring winning new art and more Spanish but with that unsparing original ending. (Let's just say things do not end well when the troublemaking tortilla encounters a fox.) The text is energetic, and the baked-in Spanish avoids feeling dumbed down; it's placed so well in context that non-Spanish-speaking readers won't feel lost. The illustrations evocatively convey the cacti, sand-beached rubble, and reptilian fauna of the Southwest as well as the crispy-masa body of the tortilla herself. Her singsong-y taunt is catchy: "Run as fast as fast can be. / You won't get a bite of me. / Doesn't matter what you do. / I'll be far ahead of you!" Anyone who's ever driven across town for the perfect taco will understand the allure of the world's most entertaining tortilla. ?Kirkus Reviews</p><h2>Jesus According to Scripture: Restoring the Portrait from the Gospels</h2><p>Jesus according to Scripture seeks to show the coherent portrait of Jesus that emerges from the Gospels, a portrait that is rooted in history and yet has produced its own historical and cultural impact.<br>Bock begins with a brief overview of each Gospel, surveying its structure, themes, authorship, setting, and date.

They were a sombre and sober group, ten men and three women, who wore hiking clothes and impressively stacked backpacks. An astute observer would have noted that their clothes and gear were all new, and that several showed signs of blisters due to their boots not being properly worn in, and that none looked happy in a woollen hat. There were no observers, however, for the flatlands are unutterably tedious and usually lacking in things worth the observing.</p> <p>Their leader paused and consulted the map again. This took the form of a large square of predominantly blank paper upon which the legend and gridlines had consumed far more ink in the printing than any physical features. There were a few paths&#x2014;even to call them &#x2018;lanes&#x2019; would be an aggrandisement&#x2014;a few ditches with pretensions towards being streams, and one long earthwork that travelled into the centre of the map and then petered out, as so many things in the flatlands tended to. Drystone walls, interest, lives&nbsp;&#x2026; all fading away.</p> <p>At least the earthwork had the decency to stick up: a long railway bed for a spur line to nowhere, abandoned decades before. They could see it was heavily overgrown on the steep sides of the artificial ridge, but there were also signs that, relatively recently, much of the heavier undergrowth had been cut back or felled. They clambered up onto its top, past the unhealthy bushes and saplings that grew there, and found themselves on the rail bed itself, still bearing&#x2014;slightly surprisingly&#x2014;sleepers and tracks. Even more surprisingly, there was a train there, hidden behind the trees and shrubs.</p> <p>This discovery certainly surprised the hiking party, and even overawed them. The locomotive, although matte with rust the shade of dried blood, still exuded an air of exultant mechanical malevolence, as if somebody had crammed a black dragon into a giant jelly mould in the form of a steam locomotive and, with the wave of a wand, transformed the creature into the machine. But no; a wand would be insufficient. A magic staff perhaps. Or an enchanted caber. In any event, the iron dragon now slumbered in the sleep of years. Behind it was a train of assorted carriages, flatbeds, and freight cars, all once painted in black with red detailing, the exquisite work now peeling and forlorn. Just readable on the side of one of the cars was the legend <i>The World Renowned Cabal Bros. Carnival</i>.</p> <p>The leader of the group looked at the words for a long moment, and then smirked a very superior smirk of the type that starts at the corner of the mouth and finishes with trouble.</p> <p>&#x2018;This is the place,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Start the search.&#x2019;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>The search went uncommented upon by passersby because there were no passersby. The flatlands went nowhere in either geographical or metaphorical terms, and no one went into them without the explicit intent to come out again, quickly. It was, in theory, an ideal place for footpads to operate, but the lack of potential victims had always kept its criminal population low, dwindling to none in relatively recent times. So there was nobody to see as twelve hikers, chivvied on by the thirteenth, dutifully dumped their packs, split the area into a search grid, produced strangely wrought weights on lengths of cord from identical pouches each had in their duffel coat pockets, and proceeded to methodically dowse the squares of the grid one by one. As an activity, it combined the mundane with the strange with the clandestine, and thereby rendered itself sinister. This was fair, for their intentions were sinister.</p> <p>Nor was their apparent efficiency a chimera. Within ten minutes one of the hikers was excitingly calling to their leader. He came over, as did the others, to see the hiker&#x2019;s plumb weight swinging in a manner harsh and angular, showing a brutalist disregard for physics that would have made Galileo enter the priesthood. They watched it twitch in silence, watched it marking out a pentacle in the air.</p> <p>&#x2018;Here?&#x2019; whispered the hiker, aquiver with excitement.</p> <p>&#x2018;Here,&#x2019; said their leader with magisterial certainty.</p> <p>Again, their activities were efficient yet strange. Quickly they doffed duffel coats and woolly hats and map cases. Quickly they donned robes and then struggled to strip naked beneath them like a charabanc party changing at the beach of a Whitsun weekend. When the undignified hopping and kicking off of trousers was complete, they hastened to create a circle of blue powder about the spot they had detected, and then they gathered around it as the dying sun sank beneath the horizon. It wasn&#x2019;t a happy circle&#x2014;they were now all barefooted and the area was scattered with chippings from the rail bed&#x2014;but it was a disciplined one, and they awaited the words of their leader.</p> <p>When they came, they were incomprehensible.</p> <p><i>&#x2018;Vateth He&#x2019;em!&#x2019;</i> he cried, excellent projection betraying a thwarted career in the theatre. <i>&#x2018;Oomaloth T&#x2019;y&#x2019;araskile!&#x2019;</i> And so he continued, booming forth an apparently endless litany of dreadful names and imprecations from memory, all bedewed with apostrophes. The hikers-turned-cultists chanted the occasional response, a <i>&#x2018;Gilg&#x2019;ya!&#x2019;</i> here and a <i>&#x2018;Ukriles!&#x2019;</i> there, and kept their eyes turned to the ground, for the grey skies were darkening and a wind was rising. Something was coming, and none dared to see its arrival.</p> <p>Around them, the air swirled, centring upon the blue circle. The powder was blown, yet remained in the place, stray motes caught and carried back into it. The breeze was not dispersing the circle; it was concentrating it.</p> <p>The landscape flickered under silent lightning, and those present scented a change in the air, a mixture of rage and blood that dizzied the mind and turned the stomach. Something wrathful was coming, a creature of death, and their fear was mixed with triumph, for all this was planned. The wind turned and dust was drawn in from their surroundings, drawn in from across the circle to grow in the middle, skittering particles the colour of bone, dancing from their hiding places between stones and from the soil itself. Nearby, a tattered and faded jacket fluttered where it lay at the base of the earthwork.</p> <p>Then, with a roar that they felt rather than heard, the circle was filled, and they all fell silent in the awful presence, an aching tintinnabulation of the soul sounding a single peal within their hearts that turned their knees weak with dread as it faded.</p> <p>&#x2018;Master,&#x2019; said the leader of the cultists. It came out weakly, his mouth and throat dry. He swallowed and tried again, stumbling over his carefully prepared words. &#x2018;Master, you bless us with your baleful&nbsp;&#x2026; personage. We fall in obeisance before you.&#x2019;</p> <p>It took a moment before they collectively realised that they&#x2019;d forgotten to fall, and there were a few seconds of hasty kneeling and sharp intakes of breath as bare knees found jagged gravel.</p> <p>The leader was belatedly realising that he could have organised the circle a little better before now and he was reduced to hissing urgently, &#x2018;The sacrifices! The sacrifices!&#x2019; until the three women in the group were gathered before the monster in the circle.</p> <p>&#x2018;Master,&#x2019; said the leader, eager to recover face, &#x2018;Lord of the Dead. Please accept these sacrifices we humbly offer you, that you may feed and gain strength after your long and dreamless sleep.&#x2019; He lowered his head and hoped that three would be enough. Even among their fanatical ranks, it had proved difficult to find three who would willingly sacrifice themselves for the greater good.</p> <p>Then the Lord of the Dead spoke.</p> <p>And he said, &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m not a bit peckish. Famished, in fact. But not nearly as much as I&#x2019;m surprised. And naked. I don&#x2019;t suppose anyone thought to bring along a spare pair of trousers, did they? There are ladies present, and I was raised to believe that being naked in front of strange ladies is something reserved for special occasions.&#x2019;</p> <p>They had not, in fact, remembered to bring along any clothes for the Lord of the Dead, indicating another failure in planning that would later result in some sharply worded memos. One of the cultists was, however, about the same size as the Lord of the Dead, and was pleased to give him a change of clothes from his pack. The Lord of the Dead thanked him and promised that he would give them back, freshly laundered, as soon as he was able. The cultist said it was fine, really. The Lord of the Dead insisted, and also said that everybody should stop calling him &#x2018;Master&#x2019; and the &#x2018;Lord of the Dead&#x2019;, and just call him &#x2018;Horst&#x2019; instead, because that was his name.</p> <p>&#x2018;My Lord Horst,&#x2019; said the leader, who was slightly scandalised that any puissant supernatural force of darkness and destruction should want to be on first-name terms so early in their acquaintance, &#x2018;you <i>must</i> feed.&#x2019;</p> <p>It was true; Horst did not look well after his period as dust. His eyes were sunken deep within their sockets and bone showed beneath the parchment of his skin. He looked like a corpse in the mid-stages of mummification, and his borrowed trousers would not stay up without assistance.</p> <p>The three women who knelt at his bony feet were quickly running through personal variants of &#x2018;It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done&#x2019;, and drew back their cowls and exposed their jugulars to him.</p> <p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; said Horst, shaking his head slowly, the best speed his desiccated neck could manage. &#x2018;No, no, no. That&#x2019;s not enough.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Not&nbsp;&#x2026; enough?&#x2019; The leader looked around the circle of his acolytes and saw faces as worried as his own. &#x2018;How many will you require?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, if I just feed from these three&nbsp;&#x2026; Hello, ladies&nbsp;&#x2026; I&#x2019;ll kill them, and that&#x2019;s not very polite. If I take a little from all of you, nobody has to die. I&#x2019;m sure everybody would be happier with that, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x2019;</p> <p>The leader was slightly baffled. &#x2018;But, master&#x2026;&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Horst.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;My Lord Horst, you are the embodiment of Death. You live without breath or vital spark in the umbral shadows, you are the wolf that preys upon we mortal cattle, you are&#x2026;&#x2019; The leader&#x2019;s voice was no longer very magisterial, just petty and wheedling. &#x2018;Well, you&#x2019;re a <i>vampire</i>, damn it. We brought these three here specially.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sure their mothers&nbsp;&#x2026; Hello, ladies&nbsp;&#x2026; didn&#x2019;t raise them to be all-you-can-eat buffets. As for me, I&#x2019;ve beaten up a few people in my time, but I&#x2019;ve never killed anyone. Never felt the need to. I&#x2019;m not saying I&#x2019;m incapable of it, but it&#x2019;s not something I&#x2019;ve ever really aspired to, yes?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;But you&#x2019;re the Lord of the Dead!&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;No,&#x2019; said the monster in the loose clothes. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m Horst Cabal, and I don&#x2019;t murder for the sake of a snack. Now, as you pointed out, I need to feed. I shall only take what each of you can spare.&#x2019;</p> <p>The leader was feeling peevish that the sacrifice that he had so selflessly ordered others to make was being snubbed. &#x2018;We dragged those three all the way out here for nothing,&#x2019; he muttered furiously under his breath. Unhappily for him, inhumanly sharp senses are common amongst vampiric folk.</p> <p>&#x2018;I think,&#x2019; said Horst, regarding the leader with a wolfish expression, &#x2018;we&#x2019;ll start with you, shall we? Leading from the front, and all that.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Me?&#x2019; The leader was certainly intending to protest in the strongest terms, but then he made the mistake of looking at Horst&#x2019;s eyes and whatever he had been intending was lost in a sudden simplification of his mind&#x2019;s working.</p> <p>Horst flicked back the leader&#x2019;s cowl with an offhand gesture, took hold of his hair, and pulled his head back to expose his throat. &#x2018;Yes. You.&#x2019; Horst&#x2019;s lips parted and unusually long canine teeth showed as he leaned in. He paused and said to the silent onlookers, &#x2018;The rest of you, form an orderly queue.&#x2019;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>About halfway through the ad hoc transfusion session, Horst noticed that those that had already donated were clearly envied by those that hadn&#x2019;t, and those that hadn&#x2019;t were being patronised by those that had. He wondered vaguely if, in the time he had been away, vampirism had become fashionable. How long <i>had</i> he been away, exactly?</p> <p>He was feeling sated before he had finished with the ninth. Not completely revivified, he knew, but he was conscious of taking too much too quickly. He had been careful the first time he had drunk blood, and that had proved wise. It would prove equally wise to stop now, but then he looked at the faces of Victims 10&#x2013;13 and felt he couldn&#x2019;t let them down. Sighing inwardly, he finished with 9 and wearily gestured over 10. It would just be a nip, but at least duty would be honoured. His situation was not improved by 13, the third of the women, who insisted on making orgasmic noises at the first graze of his fangs. Under the circumstances, it seemed ungentlemanly to be perfunctory, and so he soldiered on until she&#x2019;d run out of expressions of passion. He straightened up, feeling replete, reborn, and generally resanguinated, but also irked that performance anxiety should pursue a fellow beyond the grave.</p> <p>&#x2018;So,&#x2019; he said as the cultists&#x2014;practically, if unromantically&#x2014;passed around a box of sticking plasters, &#x2018;now what?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;We must take you to the castle with all dispatch, my lord,&#x2019; said the leader, who it transpired was called Encausse.</p> <p>&#x2018;The castle. Of course. Should have known there would be a castle involved. Which particular castle would that be?&#x2019;</p> <p>Encausse looked uncomfortable, and Horst guessed he was wrestling between a conspirator&#x2019;s natural desire for secrecy and a conspirator&#x2019;s equally natural desire to tell everyone how brilliant the conspiracy is. &#x2018;I am not permitted to say, my lord.&#x2019;</p> <p>Horst considered softening his mind a little until the concept of &#x2018;permission&#x2019; became more malleable, but reined in the impulse. After all, that was the sort of thing real monsters did, and Horst didn&#x2019;t care for it.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, is it far?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, my lord. It will take several days to transport you there. I am sorry.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;For what?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;The inconvenience.&#x2019;</p> <p>Horst looked down at his newly reconstituted hands, and rubbed them in the manner of one getting down to brass tacks. &#x2018;The inconvenience&nbsp;&#x2026; Well, don&#x2019;t be too hard on yourself. You&#x2019;ve resurrected me, which was decent of you. We&#x2019;ll just consider ourselves even between that and the inconvenience.&#x2019;</p> <p>Horst was finding all manner of things not to like about the situation, and nestling high upon the parapets of his misgivings was why such a band of well-equipped and well-informed eccentrics had gone to all this trouble in the first place. For the first time he felt a small pang in his slowly beating heart. He hoped Johannes was still alive somewhere and he wished he could be here. All this occult malarkey was much more his brother&#x2019;s meat and drink. Johannes would have identified the group concerned, insulted everyone, and probably settled into a spirited gunfight by this juncture. The pang troubled Horst again; to his profound surprise, he was missing his brother.</p> <p>He looked at Encausse and saw the man was nervous. Horst guessed he&#x2019;d got it into his head that vampires kill people willy-nilly for every little disappointment. Perhaps they usually did. How would he know? Nobody had ever given him an induction lecture or even a pamphlet on the subject. He spoke to defuse the tension as much as anything. &#x2018;And how do you intend to get me to this castle? I think my passport has probably run out by now and, anyway, wouldn&#x2019;t being dead invalidate it?&#x2019;</p> <p>Encausse waved away the point, his relief at not being s...</p></p><h2>Great Ideas Days of Reading (Penguin Great Ideas)</h2><p>In these inspiring essays about why we read, Proust explores all the pleasures and trials that we take from books, as well as explaining the beauty of Ruskin and his work, and the joys of losing yourself in literature as a child.

With style, humor, and spare, elegant prose, Fisher retraces her adventures in France as a young housewife, recalls her return to California, and ruminates on such favorite themes as food, literature, and relationships.</p><p>This is the last book written by Fisher prior to her death in 1992?and her third volume of memoirs, following To Begin Again (LJ 10/15/92) and Stay Me, Oh Comfort Me (LJ 9/1/93). Last House is a collection of 68 short pieces written over the last 48 years of Fisher's life, 46 of them written in the 1980s. Only three of the pieces have been previously published. This last memoir is a collection of random thoughts, ideas, feelings, and experiences related to such things as bugs, death, dreams, strip searches, sleeping pills, meals, suicide, and sleep. Fisher exudes a bittersweet tone that is both calming and unsettling as she writes frankly about the distastefulness of living with and caring for her elderly father; her attitudes toward people who like her; the frustration of living, aging, and dying; and her furstration and anger at being a writer unable to read, write, or speak as arthritis and Parkinson's disease overtake her. Although a few of the earlier pieces elude clear meaning and purpose, most of this collection should be read for its frankness and realism, particularly by the aging and by those caring for the aged or terminally ill.?Jeris Cassel, Rutgers Univ. Libs., New Brunswick, N.J.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.M. F. K. Fisher (1908^-92) brought great pleasure to lovers of fine prose and good food. A frank and sensual writer, she wrote with well-tempered passion about her unusual life and powerful appetites. This is her last book, and it is a fitting farewell. Fisher started this project full of ambition but completed it besieged by pain and frustration as Parkinson's disease severed the once reliable link between her crystal-clear mind and life-loving body. As Fisher had to give up first the keyboard, then the pen, she decided to mix older, never before published pieces with new ones, thus creating a wonderfully diverse set of tart and feisty reminiscences, observations, and confessions. Fisher's humor is as sharp and dry as a good martini when she writes about husbands and lovers, friends and adversaries, food and restaurants, travels and home. Her tone deepens in her final pieces as she focuses on aging and expresses her impatience with the "winding down" that precedes death, but we'll always picture Fisher bright-eyed and elegant, never missing a trick or at a loss for words. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Reading Barth with Charity</h2><p>Karl Barth and his legacy have influenced Christian theological discussion for many decades. &nbsp;In this volume George Hunsinger, a world-renowned expert on Barth's theology, makes an authoritative contribution to the debate concerning Barth's trinitarian theology and doctrine of election. &nbsp;He challenges recent, revisionist interpretations of Barth, arguing that there is no break in Barth's trinitarian doctrine between the earlier and later volumes of the&nbsp;<i>Church Dogmatics</i>. &nbsp;At the same time he discusses core issues in theology and christology that extend well beyond contemporary Barth debates.

After completing his studies in Italy and at Columbia University, he worked for two New York newspapers. He returned to Italy in 1930 to become a correspondent for <i>Corriere della Sera.</i> In 1940 he was confined by the Fascists. With the Allied liberation he returned to publishing and founded <i>Il Globo.</i> Subsequently he served as the chief editor of several newspapers and magazines. His books include <i>Americans Are Alone in the World</i> (1958), <i>From Caesar to the Mafia</i> (1971), and <i>Peking to Paris</i> (1973). He died in 1984.<b>CHAPTER ONE</b><br><br><i>THE PEACEFUL INVASION</i><br><br>Italians are pleased and perplexed. Every year since the end of the war they have seen the number of foreign visitors to their country increase at an incredibly rapid rate. The phenomenon has now reached unprecedented, practically inexplicable, and almost alarming proportions. In the 1950s the tourists numbered eight, ten, twelve million yearly. A little later, only yesterday, they were fifteen, seventeen, nineteen million. They have now passed the twenty million mark, a proportion of more than one tourist to every two and a half Italians, and the total is still growing. It appears that, if circumstances remain favourable, the travellers will reach thirty million within a decade, and will eventually match and even surpass the number of native inhabitants in the peninsula. Nothing daunts foreigners. Nothing frightens them. Nothing stops them. They arrive in a steady stream, by all forms of transport and even on foot, by day and night, from the sea or via the Alps. What is but a small trickle in the winter months grows in the spring to the size of a stream, and, in April, May, and June, turns into a monsoon flood, breaking all dikes, covering everything in sight. It begins to recede in September. It never completely dries up.<br><br>People come from all parts of the five known continents, from the old established nations of Europe and America and from the newly founded ones in Africa and Asia. The largest number come from the north, the vast, democratic, bourgeois, industrial north of Europe and America. Some now also come from Russia, in some ways the most northerly of all countries, organized parties of sightseers, behaving like military units traversing a dangerous territory inhabited by treacherous natives, as diffident and self-contained as Xenophon's Greeks marching across Asia Minor. Russian tourists all wear the same box-like clothes, as new as those of provincial newly-weds, and ankle-length raincoats. They look well-fed, self-satisfied, and well-behaved. They appear eager to acquire as much culture, in all its forms, as rapidly and cheaply as possible. They have a disturbing resemblance to the diligent German tourists at the beginning of the century, the solid subjects of William II.<br><br>There are many travellers who, in order to obey the urge that drives them south, abandon their own countries, whose delights and tourist attractions are being advertised and celebrated all over the world. What do they seek that is better than what they left behind? Not many Italians willingly travel abroad in any direction, north, south, east or west. They always feel more or less exiled and unhappy in alien lands, and honestly believe the attractions of their homeland to be most satisfying. They are the first victims of the famous charm of Italy, never satiated with her sights, climate, food, music and life. Familiarity never breeds contempt in them. Neapolitans, for instance, after many thousand years, still gaze with the same rapture on their native landscape, eat <i>spaghetti alle vongole</i> as if they had never tasted them before, and compose endless songs dedicated to the immortal beauty of their women and their bay. Those Italians who travel abroad are, as a rule, the privileged -- Milanese industrialists and Roman princes who have adopted foreign ways, cabinet ministers, diplomats, newly-weds -- and the disinherited who go looking for work. They are usually all equally homesick abroad; the rich and the poor look for <i>caff� espresso,</i> a good Italian restaurant, wherever they go, and sigh for the day of their return.<br><br>At the high tide of the tourist season, from early June till late September, visitors fill every empty space available in Italy. Trains, buses, boats, restaurants, churches, museums, Greek and Roman ruins, chapels, concert halls, historic landmarks, and famous belvederes, whence romantic landscapes (two stars in the guide books) can be admired, are packed to capacity with foreigners. One literally finds them everywhere, often at one's table, unknown friends of friends, sometimes even in one's bathroom and bed. They also fill a couple of universities, Perugia and Urbino, set aside for them, where they study the language, imbibe the Latin sun-drenched culture, make love, go swimming, and feed themselves cheaply on pasta, olive oil, tomatoes, and garlic. American universities sometimes hold summer sessions, in art appreciation, history of civilization, and related subjects, in some ancient villa on a hill-top near Florence with a view over the whole city, or a <i>palazzo</i> on the Grand Canal. Swedish and Norwegian workers' clubs have purchased wooded strips of deserted Italian coastline, where they have built their own club-houses and recreation centres.<br><br>There are sultry days in July and August when the cities, emptied by the natives, are almost completely taken over by the swarms of dusty and perspiring foreigners. During the siesta hour, when even the carriage horses sleep under their straw hats, the relentless tourists finally slow down. They bivouac everywhere. They recline on park benches, kerbstones, the stone brims of fountains, or ancient ruins. They place their heads over their crossed arms on caf� tables for a siesta among the empty bottles, the dirty napkins, and the recently purchased souvenirs. They then really look like a tired and bedraggled army after a fatiguing battle, who have occupied a city abandoned by their fleeing enemy. They have conquered. The place is theirs.<br><br>I am not talking here of the minority, the experienced foreigners who know why they come to Italy and what Italy is. Many have come here before and know their way about, others have never been here but somehow know what to do and what they want. They all avoid the heat and the dust, seldom visit the obvious places but, when they have to (the obvious places are often the most desirable), they go at convenient hours, when the crowd is away and the air is cool. They wear ordinary clothes, the same as everybody else. Some are in love with nature, others with art, culture, archaeology, or music. Some like meeting people and making friends, others discover little-known beaches or unexplored islands. There are those who make lengthy detours, to see some little-known masterpiece, and those who like food and wine and know the <i>trattorie</i> which only few natives and no foreigners have yet discovered. There are many who speak the language well. These easily disappear in the background. They do not interest me here. There is nothing peculiar about them. I am talking of the vast majority of tourists, the millions driven by some unknown urge.<br><br>They are so punctual and numerous that their mass arrival, in the eyes of ordinary Italians, appears as irresistible as a natural event, as ineluctable as the seasonal return of migratory birds, swallows, quails, or partridges, driven by instinct; or as an anthropological phenomenon like the migration of nomadic tribes seeking green pastures for their herds. The impression is heightened by the fact that many of these travellers look somewhat alike to Italian eyes. They dress in garishly-coloured clothes, much as the members of the ancient barbaric hordes once did and as the Gipsies and Berbers still do. A great number of Germans, Scandinavians, Britons, and Dutch have pink skins, which the sun seldom succeeds in tanning a decent brown but reddens to the tender colour of <i>prosciutto</i> or covers with freckles. They perspire freely in the heat, under their nylon shirts. They wear barbaric sandals. They have dark glasses over their eyes and their heads are bare or covered with cheap straw hats on whose brims are printed or embroidered the names of cities, sanctuaries, beaches, islands, or other famous landmarks.<br><br>There is something mysteriously significant about the behaviour of many of them. A mild frenzy takes most of them and transforms them once across the Italian border. It resembles the irresistible excitement which captures some living organisms and makes them forget themselves and everything else, when, like salmon going upstream, they obey some deep and secret impulse of Nature; or the intoxication, the gentle and sweet delirium, which makes all honeymooners quietly mad everywhere in the world and honeymooners in Italy doubly so, both because they are on their honeymoon and they are in Italy. Like all newly-weds, in fact, many ordinary travellers seem deliciously drunk with new illusions and hopes. The sedate professional man, the sober shopkeeper, the loyal employee, the rigorous scientist, the stern educator, the tidy housewife, the bespectacled spinster, the innocent maiden, the virtuous wife, the resigned husband, all behave as they probably never dared to behave before and as they probably would not behave publicly in their native habitat. More exactly, they behave as if they had shed the r�les assigned to them and the personalities bestowed on them by Nature, because such r�les and personalities had suddenly become repugnant and alien to them; or as if all the rules of the game of life had been changed or suspended. Some seem strangely deprived of all, or part of, their customary discernment, of their powers of control and discrimination, and of the scepticism, diffidence, prudence, suspicion, and fear necessary for survival in most countries. They get into all sorts of scrapes. They make friends with all sorts of people. They look at all things with indulgent and dewy eyes, apparently ready to love, admire, understand, or, at least, excuse and forgive almost everything, the good, the bad, the indifferent, the repugnant. They are often easily swindled, but many do not always mind if they are.<br><br>Most of these visitors from Northern Europe drink vast and indiscriminate quantities of wine. They drink, with equal good-natured enthusiasm, anything at all: costly vintages from famous vineyards, raw wines still smelling of sulphur and wooden staves, sweet and syrupy wines made for people who know little about such things. It is, for some curious reason, the first thing Germans and Austrians do, as soon as they cross the Brenner pass on their southward trip. They stop the car at one of the many wineshops which line both sides of the valley road, just beyond the border, as frequent as the petrol stations. Each <i>osteria</i> has a wrought-iron hanging sign, a terrace in the quivering shadow of a leafy pergola, checked table-cloths, waitresses in <i>dirndl,</i> everything designed in a tasteful fairy-story style, a style which is a mixture suited to the geographical and psychological spot, half German and half Italian, half Walt-Disney-Tyrolean and half <i>Il Trovatore</i> or Palio-di-Siena-Medieval. On the Brenner road, German and Austrian tourists behave as the Americans did under prohibition, when they rushed for the first bar across the Canadian border. There is no obvious explanation for this phenomenon. There is no scarcity of cheap wines, local or imported, in Germany and Austria. Perhaps these people are trying to quench not a physiological but a psychological thirst. This may be an unconscious magic rite; they drink wine as if it were a potion necessary to acquire a new personality, or they drink it as one drinks champagne on New Year's eve, on the stroke of midnight, to celebrate the crossing of a spiritual border and to inaugurate new hopes and a new life.<br><br>With equal indulgent enthusiasm, these summer visitors indiscriminately enjoy all kinds of doubtful attractions, things they probably shunned at home. They listen with the same breathless rapture and delighted smiles to the best opera singing in the world at Rome, Milan, or Spoleto, and to wheezy village bands, to impeccable Vivaldi quartets and to tinny dance orchestras. They eat the dainty food of famous chefs with the same pleasure with which they devour gross peasant dishes, mostly composed of garlic and tomatoes, or fisherman's octopus and shrimps, fried in heavily scented olive oil on a little deserted beach. They buy vast quantities of souvenirs to take home, smart things they cannot find elsewhere, cheap trinkets made in Japan, costly masterpieces, tawdry imitations.<br><br>Many try to speak Italian. A few creditably manage this in a short time. Others think they do. Things seem, of course, more significant and enjoyable when expressed in the native language. A spade is only a spade, a <i>Shaufel</i> but a <i>Shaufel,</i> but a <i>badile</i> cannot help being a pagan, Mediteranean, intoxicating <i>badile.</i> Some study lists of words phonetically spelled in handbooks. Some pick them up in random conversations. They also try hard to gesticulate wildly as they speak. They usually manage it in the style of amateur comedians playing an Italian character. They laugh loudly and converse with everybody, the people at the next table, travelling companions in the trains, the waiters, the beggars, the street singers, the cicerones, anybody in sight, with the same good-natured lack of discrimination with which dog lovers pet any dog.<br><br>The men, many men at least, those of all ages who have a natural bent for that sort of thing, admire and pursue Italian girls. It must be said that the Italian girls and young women, for reasons nobody knows for sure, are now more disturbingly beautiful than they have ever been in men's memory and perhaps in history, certainly more attractive and desirable than the models of the most famous statues and paintings in the past; Botticelli's 'Venus', Titian's 'Sacred Love', and Raphael's 'Fornarina' would not make anybody turn around in the streets. Italian girls are more attractive, and approachable, not only than in the past but also than in many other countries today. Feminine beauty, before the war, like prosperity, seemed to be a privilege reserved to rare local cases, but widespread among many foreigners, especially Americans. Smart Italian young men of the time anxiously awaited the disembarking of the American girls in the spring, well-shaped, well-washed, well-dressed, and incredibly long-legged, who always looked as if they really arrived from another and younger world. They were healthy, witty, free, and unafraid. Now our women, too, have somehow surprisingly acquired long and shapely legs; they have lovely and pert faces, overbearing breasts, thin waists, and harmonious behinds like double mandolins. But, more than this, they have simple, unembarrassed, friendly manners: they can say tender words with heart-breaking candour or, at times, prettily pronounce unprintable ones.<br><br>Foreign men, it is true, have always pursued women in Italy. The courtesans of Venice and Rome during the Renaissance were much appreciated. The Carnival season in Rome and Venice was for centuries merely an excuse to chase masked girls through the streets. Now the hunt has acquired a more determined, almost desperate, character. Many visitors are fascinated by the girls to the point that they often lose all powers of coherent speech and judgment: they are bewitched by the girls' sinuous and provocative walk, their inviting and hospitable ways, their smart clothes which often look as if they are sewn on them, or, more especially, their tiny two-piece bathing suits. Foreign men sometimes follow some specially provocative specimens in the street like hungry dogs following butcher boys delivering meat. Striking up an acquaintance is not always difficult, in a <i>caff�</i> or on the beach. Many men easily, too easily perhaps, find their way to some girl's bedroom. Some of these always fall deeply in love. They earnestly want to get married. They want to bring back a living souvenir of the land of sunshine and amiable ways to their gloomy countries. At the end of every summer, there are men who threaten suicide (a few kill themselves), for the love of a beautiful woman, wit...</p><h2>Fast Polymer Clay: Speedy Techniques and Projects for Crafters in a Hurry</h2><p>Presents step-by-step instructions for a variety of polymer clay projects that can be completed in an hour or less.</p><p>Sue Heaser is one of world&#39;s top experts on polymer clay.

She is married with three adult children and lives in Kent in southern England, the setting for the Luke Thanet series. <i>Last Seen Alive,</i> the fifth Inspector Thanet novel, won the prestigious British Crime Writers Association Silver Dagger Award.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> Thanet and Joan were getting ready for bed when the telephone rang. It was just after midnight. Their eyes met. <i>Alexander?</i> </p><p> Joan was nearest and she snatched up the receiver. 'Hullo?' The tension showed in every line of her body, in the intensity of her concentration. Then she relaxed. 'It's Pater,' she said, handing Thanet the phone. </p><p> The Station Officer. </p><p> Thanet found that he had been holding his breath. 'What's the problem?' he snapped. Anxiety was making him short-tempered these days. </p><p> 'Woman gone missing, sir.' </p><p> 'When was this?' </p><p> 'Couple of hours ago.' </p><p> 'Only a couple of hours? So why all the fuss? She probably had a row with her old man and walked out to cool off.' Literally and metaphorically, thought Thanet. It was high summer, school holidays and the middle of a heatwave, a prime time -- along with Christmas -- for domestic disputes to escalate. </p><p> 'Her "old man" is Mr Mintar, sir. Mr Ralph Mintar.' </p><p> The rising inflection in Pater's voice indicated that he expected Thanet to know who he was talking about. As indeed he did. </p><p> 'The QC?' </p><p> 'The same.' </p><p> 'Ah.' Thanet had come across Mintar in court from time to time. The barrister was hardly the type to lose his head in a crisis. If he had reported his wife missing he must have good reason for concern. 'I see. So what's the story?' </p><p> 'Apparently she disappeared in the middle of entertaining friends. After they finished eating they all decided to go for a swim and everyone went off to change. Only she didn't come back. It was a while before anyone noticed she wasn't there and they've been looking for her ever since.' </p><p> 'And no apparent reason for her to walk out?' </p><p> 'Not so far as PC Chambers could gather. And he's pretty much on the ball, as you know.' </p><p> 'Quite. Well, I'd better get out there. The Super been informed?' </p><p> Superintendent Draco liked to keep his finger on the pulse of what was happening on his patch. </p><p> 'He's away for the weekend, sir.' </p><p> 'Of course. I forgot.' That was a relief, anyway. Draco had a nasty habit of dogging Thanet's footsteps at the start of any remotely interesting investigation. 'Contact Lineham and lay on some reinforcements, will you? What's the address?' </p><p> 'Windmill Court, Paxton, sir.' </p><p> Thanet scribbled the directions down. It was all too easy to get lost in a maze of country lanes in the dark. </p><p> 'Sorry, love,' he said to Joan, who was in bed by now. </p><p> She shrugged. 'Can't be helped.' But her pretended insouciance did not deceive him. She would have liked him to be with her in case there was any more news. </p><p> They were both desperately worried about their daughter Bridget, who was thirty-two weeks pregnant with her first baby and had suddenly developed toxaemia. Although Lineham's wife Louise had had similar problems when their first child was born, until a few days ago Thanet and Joan hadn't known precisely what the prognosis was, but Alexander, her husband, was keeping them up to date on what was happening and they had learned fast: Bridget's blood pressure was alarmingly high and there was protein in her urine. She was therefore in danger of pre-eclampsia -- fits -- and the baby's oxygen supply was threatened. She had been taken into hospital for monitoring. </p><p> Thanet finished knotting his tie and went to sit on the bed, took Joan's hands in his. 'If you need me, just ring and I'll get back as soon as I can.' </p><p> She shook her head. 'I don't suppose we'll hear anything more tonight.' </p><p> 'All the same...' </p><p> 'I know.' </p><p> He kissed her and left. </p><p> Outside it was still very warm, well over twenty degrees,and Thanet took off his jacket and slung it on to the passenger seat before getting into the car. Then he wound down the window to get a breath of fresh air as he drove. At this time of night there was very little traffic about and once he plunged into the country lanes his seemed to be the only vehicle on the road. </p><p> In an attempt to damp down his worries about Bridget he tried to focus on Ralph Mintar. What did he know about him? Not a lot, it seemed. As a member of the South-Eastern Circuit Mintar was a familiar figure in courtrooms all over Kent and Sussex -- less so, of course, since taking silk a few years ago. QCs travel further afield, sometimes having to stay away from home for weeks or even months at a time. Still, he didn't suppose Mintar had changed much. Always looking as though he had just had a wash and brush-up, the QC was a dapper, well-groomed figure, reticent and self-contained. He belonged to what Thanet always thought of as the softly softly school of advocacy, leading witnesses gently on from one apparently innocuous point to another until they suddenly found that they had fenced themselves in and there was no way out but the direction in which counsel had wanted them to go. </p><p> Thanet knew that in a high percentage of cases of domestic murder it is the husband who has perpetrated the crime. If the worst had happened and Mrs Mintar had come to a sticky end, Mintar would be a formidable suspect to deal with. Thanet felt the first stirrings of excitement. He hoped, of course, that she would be found alive and well, but if she wasn't, well, he had always relished a challenge. </p><p> He braked sharply to avoid a rabbit which had appeared from nowhere to scuttle across the road in front of him and had then stopped dead, transfixed by his headlights. He put the car into bottom gear and began to edge forward. <i>Go on, go on,</i> he muttered. <i>Move!</i> At last, just as he was about to brake again, it turned and dashed off into the undergrowth at the side of the lane. </p><p> He was on a slight rise here and ahead of him he could now see some scattered lights. That must be Paxton. Street lighting would be sparse, as it always was in the villages, and he guessed that there would be few people still up -- though more than usual, perhaps, as it was a Saturday night. He was right. Apart from the occasional glow from an upstairs window, Paxton appeared to be sunk in slumber. The village consisted of one long, straggling street with a pub at each end, one of them opposite the church. There was also a Post Office cum general shop, increasingly a rarity nowadays as the supermarkets killed off their smaller rivals. </p><p> Thanet had memorised Pater's directions: Turn left at the far end of the village into Miller's Lane. Take the first right then the second left and it's on the right, a hundred yards past the windmill. </p><p> There was the dark bulk of the windmill now, its sails a stark silhouette against the night sky and this, no doubt about it, was Windmill Court, lit up like a cruise liner. Thanet swung in between the tall wrought-iron gates and halfway up the drive pulled up for a moment to admire it. The mill owner must have been a prosperous man for he had built himself a fine dwelling. Classic in proportions and as symmetrical as a child's drawing, it looked for all the world like an elegant doll's house awaiting inspection. One half expected the front to swing open, revealing exquisitely furnished miniature rooms. As Thanet studied it someone came to peer out of one of the downstairs windows. There were no cars parked at the front so he decided to follow the drive which curved off around the left side of the house. Here, in front of a long low building which had probably once been stables, were several parked cars, one of them a patrol car. Lineham's Ford Escort was not among them, he noted. As he got out a uniformed constable hurried forward to greet him. </p><p> 'Ah, Chambers,' said Thanet. 'No one else here yet?' </p><p> 'No, sir. Just the two of us until now. Simmonds is inside.' </p><p> 'They'll be along shortly. I gather you were first on the scene. Fill me in, will you?' </p><p> There wasn't much more to tell at this stage and as Thanet listened he looked around, taking in his surroundings. The cars were parked on a gravelled area which flanked a w</p></p><h2>Blackest Night: Black Lantern Corps Vol. 1</h2><p>Writers James Robinson, Peter J.

Robert Dahl examines the most basic assumptions of democratic theory, tests them against the questions raised by its critics, and recasts the theory of democracy into a new and coherent whole. He concludes by discussing the direction in which democracy must move if advanced democratic states are to exist in the future.<p>"Like democratic theory itself, Dahl's book is hugely inspiring. . . . this is a hugely impressive book, which traces the assumptions of democratic theory from 5th-century Athens to the present day and beyond. it is remarkable for its sustained attempt to connect theory and practice."&#x2014;Susan Mendus, <i>The Times Higher Education Supplement</i></p><br>"One of the foremost contemporary theorists of pluralist democracy."&#x2015;Jack Lively, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br>"[This book] could not have come at a more opportune moment. . . . <i>Democracy and Its Critics</i> is a work of extraordinary intelligence and, what is even rarer, a work of extraordinary wisdom. Mr. Dahl writes clearly and effectively. . . . The discussion is fresh and illuminating, the treatment of alternative views careful and respectful, the difficulties in his own views spelled out in detail. An attentive reader of this book will receive a real education in the meaning of democracy. . . . Beneath all the moderation and devotion to intellectual clarity that are so evident in this book, there is the moving presence of a profound passion for democracy."&#x2015;Robert N. Bellah, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br>"America's leading expert on democratic theory delivers his magnum opus."&#x2015;<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br>"Dahl defends democracy against various criticisms, including anarchism and its tenet that even democracy is coercive. . . . A necessary purchase."&#x2015;David Steiniche, <i>Library Journal</i><br>"A necessary purchase for graduate libraries and recommended for undergraduate and public libraries."&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><br>"One of the country's premier political philosophers here shares the fruit of years of thoughtful reflection upon the promise and perils of democracy. As he uncovers the foundations of democratic theory, Dahl confronts his readers with the arguments of democracy's critics, friendly and adversarial. The questions raised prove vexing. . . . a book deserving attention from Americans serious about their citizenship."&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br>"When Robert Dahl speaks about democracy, everyone should listen. With <i>Democracy and Its Critics</i> Dahl has produced a work destined to become another classic to go along with his <i>A Preface to Democratic Theory</i>. . . . Now Dahl's virtuosity takes the form of conducting a masterful dialogue of reason, of guiding a truly advanced seminar on the major ideas and arguments in the field of democratic theory broadly defined. The reader becomes a mute but engrossed participant in a brilliant but also meticulously detailed series of discussions in which few issues are skipped over or arguments left hanging, as almost every train of thought is carried to its logical termination. The atmosphere of a sustained seminar is reinforced by Dahl's ingenious use of the playwright's technique of heated dialogues and verbal crossing of swords."&#x2014;Lucian W. Pye, <i>American Political Science Review</i><br>"It's difficult to imagine a political science seminar in which this lucid and thoughtful book would not stimulate energetic discussion. . . . Even those who have followed Dahl's writings of the past forty years will find many riches. . . . This book encouraged me to think about some old problems in new ways. I encourage others to enjoy similar benefits."&#x2015;G. Bingham Powell, Jr., <i>Political Science Quarterly</i><br>"<i>Democracy and Its Critics</i> is a rigorous summary of the life work of one of America's premier political scientists. It is also a timely antidote to the right's equation of democracy with the 'freedom' of an unrestrained capitalist market. In a reasoned yet passionate tone Dahl defends democracy as a system of political equality that promotes the freedom of individuals to live under laws of their own choosing. . . . Radical theorists who have recently discovered the centrality of 'plurality' and 'civil society' owe a considerable debt to Dahl's work. . . . As Dahl's work eloquently demonstrates, the moral values of liberal democracy can only be realized if our economic institutions are shaped by the values of political equality."&#x2015;Joseph M. Schwartz, <i>Dissent</i><br>"A provocative, scholarly, and elegantly written book."&#x2015;Elizabeth P. McCaughey, <i>National Review</i><br>"This thoughtful defense of democratic values . . . provide[s] a theoretical justification for leaving public policy decisions squarely in the domain of democratically elected representatives. . . . Time spent with <i>Democracy and Its Critics</i> will repay both the scholar and the general reader with insight into the issues of democratic theory that bear on the continual debate over the proper role of an independent judiciary in a democratic society. . . . He brilliantly defends democracy against its critics, including those who would have judges play the active role of guardians in our society. Lawyers and legal scholars will benefit from the theoretical context this book brings to the debate over judicial policymaking, and the reader will appreciate the clarity and thoroughness of Dahl's entire argument."&#x2015;Cary Coglianese, <i>Michigan Law Review</i><br>"In this capstone volume, Dahl interweaves normative and empirical notions in an effort to develop a broadly integrative theory of democracy, on that is at once historically grounded, context sensitive, true to its philosophical origins, and sustainable under scrutiny. His effort is . . . remarkable. . . . <i>Democracy and Its Critics</i> is the product of literally decades of observation and analysis by one of the nation's premier political theorists, and in its breadth of vision and depth of insight it gives testimony to the quality of the author's mind. The book is well crafted, as Dahl's books always are, and is presented in a style that will prove accessible to the professional and the lay reader alike and to political scientists of both normative and empirical bent. . . . A benchmark in the development of democratic thought at a time when clear thinking about the ideal and practical forms of democracy is especially in demand."&#x2015;Jarol B. Manheim, <i>Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science</i><br>"[Dahl] does well in introducing us to the problems and dilemmas that surround the attempts to achieve democracy. . . .

More lives were lost there than in any other war fought on American soil. From Chancellorsville, where General Robert E. Lee launched his high-risk campaign into the North, to the Confederates' last daring and ultimately doomed act, forever known as Pickett's Charge, the battle of Gettysburg gave the Union army a victory that turned back the boldest and perhaps greatest chance for a Southern nation.</p><p>The last three decades have seen scores of remarkable new studies focusing on important elements of this monumental campaign. Now, acclaimed historian Noah Andre Trudeau brings the most up-to-date research available to a brilliant, sweeping, and comprehensive history that sheds new light on virtually every aspect of the battle of Gettysburg. Deftly balancing his own narrative style with revealing firsthand accounts, including excerpts from the diaries and letters of the men on both sides of the battlefield, Trudeau brings this engrossing human tale to life. He recounts the heightening tension of the campaign, the life-or-death decisions made by its commanders, and the struggle endured by thousands of its bravest soldiers. Not forgotten are the stories of the noncombatants, the thousands of civilians whose placid lives were swept into the ferocious cauldron.</p><p>Scrupulously researched and masterfully written, <em>Gettysburg</em> conveys all the drama and heroism in what is sure to be the defining account for years to come of this pivotal moment in American history. </p></p><p><p>Noah Andre Trudeau is the author of <em>Gettysburg</em>.

Trudeau allows them, from generals to enlisted men, to speak in their own words, creating a thoroughly absorbing story of determination on both sides and at all levels. Robert E. Lee began the campaign intending to win a battle of annihilation. July 1 inaugurated some of the hardest, and the most exacting, fighting American soldiers have ever done. The operational narratives are remarkable for their clarity, especially Trudeau's presentation of the confused fight for the Union left flank on July 2. The text is supplemented by sketch maps of unit positions and movements that are also models of clarity a particular boon to nonspecialist readers. Trudeau defensibly concludes that the wide latitude allowed subordinates at all levels of the Army of Northern Virginia worked against it at Gettysburg. Further, his emphasis on contemporary sources instead of postwar retrospection and academic analysis shows that despite nearly equal losses totaling almost 50,000 men Gettysburg failed as Lee's battle of annihilation.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Art Deco Architecture: Design, Decoration, and Detail from the Twenties and Thirties</h2><p><p><strong>This exploration of Art Deco architectural design embraces many different times and places in its visual and verbal account of the movement's origins, development, and influence.</strong></p> Art Deco's sheer exuberance ensured its success across the globe and it adapted to the most diverse situations, as shown by examples ranging from offices in Europe and gas stations in America to maharajahs' palaces in India and imperial dwellings in Japan. Public buildings of all kinds-whether fountain or state capitol, skyscraper or bus terminal-bear witness to its decades of popularity. Sumptuously illustrated, this unrivaled study provides a comprehensive guide to the best loved of all 20th-century architectural styles. 376 illustrations, 146 in color</p><p>Patricia Bayer is an art historian who has written extensively on Art Deco design and architecture. Her books include Art Deco Architecture, Art Deco Interiors, and Art Deco Postcards. She lives in Connecticut.From a sleekly modern apartment house in Cairo to a town hall in the Netherlands, architecture was influenced internationally by the Art Deco style, as revealed by this wide-angled, superbly illustrated survey. Bayer ( The Art of Rene Lalique ) first uncovers Art Deco's ancient and exotic sources, from Assyrian to Mayan to Moorish. Her text, wedded to 376 jazzy, snazzy illustrations (146 in color), demonstrates how this vibrant, decorative style extended between the wars into every nook and cranny of the U.S. leaving its mark on skyscrapers, movie theaters, firehouses, factories, dams, tunnels, high schools, gas stations, roadside diners and even gravestones. Bayer also examines the Art Deco revival, citing restored Miami Beach hotels as well as public buildings by Michael Graves, Robert Venturi and Helmut Jahn that echo or evoke Art Deco, a style "at once traditional and innovative." <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American Messiahs: False Prophets of a Damned Nation</h2><p><p><strong>A history with sweeping implications, <em>American Messiahs</em> challenges our previous misconceptions about &#x201c;cult&#x201d; leaders and their messianic power.</strong></p><p>Mania surrounding messianic prophets has defined the national consciousness since the American Revolution. From Civil War veteran and virulent anticapitalist Cyrus Teed, to the dapper and overlooked civil rights pioneer Father Divine, to even the megalomaniacal Jim Jones, these figures have routinely been dismissed as dangerous and hysterical outliers.</p><p>After years of studying these emblematic figures, Adam Morris demonstrates that messiahs are not just a classic trope of our national culture; their visions are essential for understanding American history. As Morris demonstrates, these charismatic, if flawed, would-be prophets sought to expose and ameliorate deep social ills&#x2015;such as income inequality, gender conformity, and racial injustice.

Composed by Abu al-Qasem Ferdowsi over a thirty-year period and completed in the year 1010, the epic has entertained generations of readers and profoundly shaped Persian culture, society, and politics. For a millennium, Iranian and Persian-speaking people around the globe have read, memorized, discussed, performed, adapted, and loved the poem.<br><br>In this book, Hamid Dabashi brings the <i>Shahnameh</i> to renewed global attention, encapsulating a lifetime of learning and teaching the Persian epic for a new generation of readers. Dabashi insightfully traces the epic&#x2019;s history, authorship, poetic significance, complicated legacy of political uses and abuses, and enduring significance in colonial and postcolonial contexts. In addition to explaining and celebrating what makes the <i>Shahnameh</i> such a distinctive literary work, he also considers the poem in the context of other epics, such as the <i>Aeneid</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>, and critical debates about the concept of world literature. Arguing that Ferdowsi&#x2019;s epic and its reception broached this idea long before nineteenth-century Western literary criticism, Dabashi makes a powerful case that we need to rethink the very notion of &#x201c;world literature&#x201d; in light of his reading of the Persian epic.</p><p>Hamid Dabashi is Hagop Kevorkian Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University. He is a founding member of the Institute for Comparative Literature and Society at Columbia University. Among his most recent books are <i>The World of Persian Literary Humanism</i> (2015) and <i>Persophilia: Persian Culture on the Global Scene</i> (2016).This enlightening scholarly study will serve, for most Western readers, as their introduction to the Persian Book of Kings. . . . Dabashi provides background on Ferdowsi and the pre-Islamic epic tradition that shaped his poem before sharing colorful accounts of its cast of warrior kings, rebellious offspring, and seductive courtesans. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Monumental epic. (M. A. Orthofer <i>The Complete Review</i>)<br><br>This is a work of imaginative activism. Hamid Dabashi coaxes and cajoles the reader to achieve the critical intimacy with the founding epic of Iran that he himself has acquired from childhood and through teaching and parenting. Historically conscientious, he is aware of the abuses of nationalism and triumphalism. His <i>Shahnameh</i> is a metaphysical epic of worthy failure. Such readings open many worlds, shaming the Eurocentric binaries of 'world literature.' (Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, University Professor, Columbia University)<br><br>A major achievement. With wit and erudition, Hamid Dabashi has pushed open one of the great locked doors of world literature: the <i>Shahnameh</i>. In bringing the central work of Persian literature vividly to life, he also offers us a new way to understand all epics. More likely, in Dabashi&#x2019;s brilliant reading, to undermine imperialistic ambitions than to proclaim them, the <i>Shahnameh</i> and its fellow epic poems reassert their relevance in our troubled times. (Aravind Adiga, author of <i>The White Tiger</i>)<br><br>This is an important book that will make its readers reconsider what they think they know about Iran&#x2019;s national epic. It situates the poem in three contexts: The imperial world in which it was born, the world that it envisions, and the postcolonial world in which it is read and understood. Writing as a learned and passionate critic, Dabashi succeeds in placing the <i>Shahnameh</i> in the corpus of world literature, but somewhere beyond the reach of Eurocentrism. Like Dabashi&#x2019;s other works, it will stay with its readers, and will open new vistas for the specialist and the nonspecialist alike. (Mahmoud Omidsalar, author of <i>Poetics and Politics of Iran's National Epic, the</i> Shahnameh)<br><br>This is a work of love and care on the foundational story telling of the Persianate. Dabashi guides the reader to avoid the traps of the Eurocentered idea of 'world literature.' He invites us to reimagine and rewrite it starting from the <i>Shahanameh</i> instead of from a canonical Western narrative. A powerful political statement that shifts the geography of 'world literature.' (Walter Mignolo, coauthor of <i>On Decoloniality: Concepts, Analytics, Praxis</i>)<br><br>In <i>The Shahnameh</i>, Hamid Dabashi shows the global importance of the tenth-century Persian masterpiece and gives readers a strong sense of its literary magnificence. Dabashi allows us to see the world imagined by Abolqasem Ferdowsi in its richness and complexity eight centuries before Goethe made his influential claim for <i>Weltliteratur</i> and, thereby, helps us expand our sense of the world of literature. After reading Dabashi&#x2019;s magisterial account of the great Iranian epic, we must return to the ongoing debates in world literature anew. (Brian Edwards, author of <i>After the American Century: The Ends of U.S. Culture in the Middle East</i>)<br><br>It is not preaching to the politically converted that achieves Dabashi&#x2019;s goal of compelling others to read Ferdowsi&#x2019;s epic. It is his love of his native epic coupled with his obvious gifts as a teacher that succeed where the tired cultural politics of the postcolonial academy fail. . . . Highly recommended. (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>For those who wish to deepen their understanding of Persian poetry and literary history, <i>The Shahnameh: The Persian Epic as World Literature</i> makes a worthy companion to the English translation by Dick Davis. (<i>Australian Book Review</i>)<br><br>Dabashi has been teaching the <i>Shahnameh</i> for several years now and in his previous books, he has written in detail about Persian culture and literary tradition. This expertise, combined with his lucid writing, brings the epic alive and makes the reader curious about the world in which it was written, (<i>Asian Review of Books</i>)</p><h2>Kosher USA: How Coke Became Kosher and Other Tales of Modern Food (Arts and Traditions of the Table: Perspectives on Culinary History)</h2><p><i>Kosher USA</i> follows the fascinating journey of kosher food through the modern industrial food system. It recounts how iconic products such as Coca-Cola and Jell-O tried to become kosher; the contentious debates among rabbis over the incorporation of modern science into Jewish law; how Manischewitz wine became the first kosher product to win over non-Jewish consumers (principally African Americans); the techniques used by Orthodox rabbinical organizations to embed kosher requirements into food manufacturing; and the difficulties encountered by kosher meat and other kosher foods that fell outside the American culinary consensus. <br><br><i>Kosher USA</i> is filled with big personalities, rare archival finds, and surprising influences: the Atlanta rabbi Tobias Geffen, who made Coke kosher; the lay chemist and kosher-certification pioneer Abraham Goldstein; the kosher-meat magnate Harry Kassel; and the animal-rights advocate Temple Grandin, a strong supporter of <i>shechita</i>, or Jewish slaughtering practice. By exploring the complex encounter between ancient religious principles and modern industrial methods, <i>Kosher USA </i>adds a significant chapter to the story of Judaism's interaction with non-Jewish cultures and the history of modern Jewish American life as well as American foodways.</p><p>Roger Horowitz is a food historian and director of the Center for the History of Business, Technology, and Society at the Hagley Museum and Library.

(<i>Jewish Book Council</i>)<br><br>In a work that is equal parts history, memoir, and cultural analysis, Horowitz traces the dramatic rise of kosher food products, specifically how they made their way into American food culture and were later popularized in the mass market of consumer products. (<i>Library Journal (starred review)</i>)<br><br>You don't have to be Jewish to love Roger Horowitz's <i>Kosher USA</i>! It is three stories in one: a family narrative within a history of kosher within the industrialization of the American food system. Well researched, insightful, and delightful&#x2015;even for goyim. (Andrew Smith, editor in chief, <i>Savoring Gotham: A Food Lover's Companion to New York City</i>)<br><br>Roger Horowitz's<i> Kosher USA</i> is a window into the world of the Jewish dietary laws and the conflict between being American and being kosher. The fascinating narrative tells the story of sturgeon, Coca Cola and Jello, as well as the intricate process of koshering meat in the modern world with the pivotal role of Temple Grandin and the large meat processors. An informative read for those who know and those who know nothing about kosher food's place in the American food system. (Joan Nathan, author of <i>Jewish Cooking in America</i>)<br><br><i>Kosher USA</i> introduces us to a remarkable cast of characters: the rabbis, scientists, home cooks, food companies and activists who spent decades wrestling with the term "kosher" in a passionate effort to tame it. Based on a rich array of sources, written with warmth and insight, this is an exhilarating study of how an ancient religious scruple became a modern American empire. (Laura Shapiro, author of <i>Perfection Salad: Women and Cooking at the Turn of the Century</i>)<br><br>Set in the context of Jewish ascendancy into the middle class, <i>Kosher U.S.A.</i> traces the way in which changes in modes of production and the lure of consumption battered, challenged, and sustained an ancient Jewish practice. Horowitz tells a very readable story about the convergence of technology, science, religion, animal-rights activism, and ordinary Jewish consumers. There is no other book like it.

Roger Horowitz understands that arcane arguments over glycerin, rennet, and gelatin, and improbable tales concerning Coke, Kedem, Rubashkin, and Manischewitz form part of a larger and more important story.

It was a time of backward-seeming notions, when almost everyone still accepted the biblical account of creation as the literal truth and authoritarianism as the most natural and viable social order. But by the time both men died, the world had changed: ordinary people understood that life on earth was a story of continuous evolution, and the Civil War had proved that a democracy could fight for principles and endure. And with these signal insights much else had changed besides. Together, Darwin and Lincoln had become midwives to the spirit of a new world, a new kind of hope and faith.<br><br>Searching for the men behind the icons of emancipation and evolution, Adam Gopnik shows us, in this captivating double life, Lincoln and Darwin as they really were: family men and social climbers; ambitious manipulators and courageous adventurers; the living husband, father, son, and student behind each myth. How do we reconcile Lincoln, the supremely good man we know, with the hardened commander who wittingly sent tens of thousands of young soldiers to certain death? Why did the relentlessly rational Darwin delay publishing his &#x201c;Great Idea&#x201d; for almost twenty years? How did inconsolable grief at the loss of a beloved child change each man? And what comfort could either find&#x2014;for himself or for a society now possessed of a sadder, if wiser, understanding of our existence? Such human questions and their answers are the stuff of this book.<br><br>Above all, we see Lincoln and Darwin as thinkers and writers&#x2014;as makers and witnesses of the great change in thought that marks truly modern times: a hundred years after the Enlightenment, the old rule of faith and fear finally yielding to one of reason, argument, and observation not merely as intellectual ideals but as a way of life; the judgment of divinity at last submitting to the verdicts of history and time. Lincoln considering human history, Darwin reflecting on deep time&#x2014;both reshaped our understanding of what life is and how it attains meaning. And they invented a new language to express that understanding. <i>Angels and Ages</i> is an original and personal account of the creation of the liberal voice&#x2014;of the way we live now and the way we talk at home and in public. Showing that literary eloquence is essential to liberal civilization, Adam Gopnik reveals why our heroes should be possessed by the urgency of utterance, obsessed by the need to see for themselves, and endowed with the gift to speak for us all.</p><p><b>Adam Gopnik</b> has been writing for <i>The New Yorker</i> since 1986. He is a three-time winner of the National Magazine Award for Essays and for Criticism and the George Polk Award for Magazine Reporting. From 1995 to 2000, he lived in Paris; he now lives in New York City with his wife and their two children.The middleweight champion [of the early twentieth century, Stanley Ketchel] was stunned by [Wilson] Mizner&#x2019;s recitation of the Langdon Smith classic that starts &#x201c;When you were a tadpole and I was a fish, In the Palaeozoic time&#x201d; and follows the romance of two lovers from one geological age to another, until they wind up in Delmonico&#x2019;s. Ketchel had a thousand questions about the tadpole and the fish, and Mizner, a pedagogue at heart,took immense pleasure in wedging the whole theory of evolution into the fighter&#x2019;s untutored head. Ketchel became silent and thoughtful. He declined an invitation to see the town that night with Mizner and [Willus] Britt. When they rolled in at 5 a.m., Ketchel was sitting up with his eyes glued on a bowl of goldfish. &#x201c;That evolution is all the bunk!&#x201d;he shouted angrily,&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve beenwatching those fish nine hours and they haven&#x2019;t changed a bit.&#x201d;Mizner had to talk fast; one thing Ketchel couldn&#x2019;t bear was to have anybody cross him.<br>&#x2014;Alva Johnston, <i>The Legendary Mizners</i><br>Americans seemed to fascinate Picasso. Once, in Paris, he invited the Murphys to his apartment, on the Rue de la Bo�tie, for an ap�ritif, and, after showing them through the place, in every room of which were pictures in various stages of completion, he led Gerald rather ceremoniously to an alcove that contained a tall cardboard box. &#x201c;It was full of illustrations, photographs, engravings, and reproductions clipped from newspapers. All of them dealt with a single person&#x2014;Abraham Lincoln. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve been collecting them since I was a child,&#x2019; Picasso said, &#x2018;I have thousands, thousands!&#x2019; He held up one of Brady&#x2019;s photographs of Lincoln, and said with great feeling, &#x2018;There is the real American elegance!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Calvin Tomkins, <i>Living Well Is the Best Revenge</i><br>We are all pebbles dropped in the sea of history, where the splash strikes one way and the big tides run another, and though what we <i>feel </i>is the splash, the splash takes place only within those tides. In almost every case, the incoming current drowns the splash; once in a while the drop of the pebble changes the way the ocean runs. On February 12, 1809, two baby boys were born within a few hours of each other on either side of the Atlantic. One entered life in a comfortable family home, nicely called the Mount, that still stands in the leafy English countryside of Shrewsbury, Shropshire; the other opened his eyes for the first time in a nameless long- lost log cabin in the Kentucky woods. Charles Darwin was the fifth of six children, born into comfort but to a family that was far from &#x201c;safe,&#x201d; with a long history of freethinking and radical beliefs. He came into a world of learning and money&#x2014;one grandfather, Josiah Wedgwood, had made a fortune in ceramic plates. Abraham Lincoln was the second of three, born to a dirt- poor farmer, Thomas Lincoln, who, when he wrote his name at all, wrote it (his son recalled) &#x201c;bunglingly.&#x201d; <br><br>Their narrow circles of immediate experience were held inside that bigger ocean of outlying beliefs and assumptions. In any era, there are truths that people take as obvious, stories that they think are weird or wrong, and dreams that they believe are distant or doomed. (We like stories about time travel and living robots, and even have some speculative thoughts about how they might be made to happen. But on the whole we believe that the time we&#x2019;re living in, and the way we live in it, is just the natural way things are. We <i>like</i> strange stories but believe only a few.) The obvious truths of 1809, the kind that were taught in school, involved what could be called a &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; organization of life, one in which we imagine a hierarchy of species organized on earth, descending from man on down toward animals, and a judge appraising us up above in heaven. Man was stuck in the middle, looking warily up and loftily down. People mostly believed that the kinds of organisms they saw on earth had always been here and always would be, that life had been fixed in place since the beginning of a terrestrial time, which was thought to go back a few thousand years at most. The eighteenth-century Enlightenment had, of course, already deepened a faith in Reason among the elite, but it was not a popular movement. It had altered many ideas without changing most minds. ( John Stuart Mill could say, as late as the 1850s, that he was still almost the only Englishman he knew who had not been brought up as a believer.) The Enlightenment ideal of Reason was in any case bound by taxonomies and hierarchies, absolute and extended right through earth and time. That the long history of life might be one driven by shifting coalitions of contingency, with chance having at least one hand on the reins, was still a mostly unthinkable idea. The forms of life were set, and had never varied. &#x201c;Species have a real existence in nature, and a transition from one to another does not exist&#x201d; was the way one magus put it, decisively.<br><br>People also believed, using what they called examples ancient and modern&#x2014;and the example of the Terror in France, which had only very recently congealed into Napoleon&#x2019;s empire, was a strong case&#x2014;that societies without inherited order were intrinsically weak, unstable, and inclined to dissolve into anarchy or tyranny. Democracy in the sense we mean it now was a fringe ideal of a handful of radicals. Even in America the future of democracy was unclear, in part because of the persistence of slavery, which was still a feature of Western life. Democracy was hard to tell from mob rule and the tyranny of mob rule. Democracy existed, and was armed, but didn&#x2019;t feel entirely liberal; the difference between reformist parliamentary government and true democracy seemed disturbingly large even to well- intentioned people. In the 1830s, Tocqueville, sympathetic to American democracy, was still skeptical about its chances, writing that &#x201c;until men have changed their nature and been completely transformed, I shall refuse to believe in the duration of a government which is called upon to hold together forty different nations covering an area half that of Europe, to avoid all rivalry, ambition, and struggles between them, and to unite all their independent wills in the accomplishment of common designs.&#x201d; Throughout Europe and America many thoughtful, truth- seeking people also believed in divine judgment and an afterlife in more or less literal terms.<br><br>The thought of no time is monolithic, and the people of 1809 in England and America did not believe these things absolutely. The new science of geology was pressing back the history of the earth; old bones would start turning up that threatened old stories; the new textual studies of the Bible were pressing against an easy acceptance of their truth, too. And there were many Utopian radical democrats in both countries. We can find plenty of astonishing ideas in that day, just as we will find traces of the astonishing ideas of the next century somewhere on the fringes of our own time. But on the whole these ideas belonged to the world of what would have been called &#x201c;fancy,&#x201d; not fact.<br><br>By the time Abraham Lincoln and Charles Darwin were dead&#x2014;the American murdered by a pro- slavery terrorist in 1865, the Englishman after a long illness in 1882&#x2014;the shape of history had changed, and the lives they had led and the things they had said had done a lot to change it. Two small splashes had helped to move the tide of time. Very different beliefs, ones that we now treat as natural and recognize as just part of the background hum of our time, were in place: the world was understood to be very, very old, and the animals and plants in it were known to have changed dramatically over the aeons&#x2014;and though just how they had changed was still debated, the best guesses, then as now, involved slow alteration through a competition for resources over a very long time. People were convinced, on the whole, that democratic government, arrived at by reform or revolution, was a plausible and strong way to organize a modern nation&#x2014;that republican regimes were fighters and survivors. (A giant statue, one of the largest since antiquity, of a goddess of Liberty was under construction in once- again republican France for a vindicated republican America, just to commemorate this belief.) Slavery in the Western world was, for the first time in thousands of years, finished (although racism wasn&#x2019;t). Liberal republicanism and universalist democracy had begun the steady merger that persists to this day, so that most of us no longer see the governing systems of Canada and the United States as decisively, rather than locally, different.<br><br>Most of all, people thought that, in one way or another, by some hand or another, the world had changed and would continue to change, that the hierarchies of nature and race and class that had governed the world, where power fell in a fixed chain on down, were false. Fixity was not reality. Life changed, and ways of living changed, too. Life was increasingly lived on what we can think of as a horizontal, with man looking behind only to see what had happened before, and forward to see what he could make next. On that horizontal plane, we are invested in our future as much as in our afterlife, and in our children more than in our ancestors. These beliefs, which we hold still, are part of what we call the modern condition&#x2014;along with the reactive desire to erase the instability that change brings with it, to get us thinking up and down again, instead of merely back and forth.<br><br>The two boys born on the same day to such different lives had become, as they remain, improbable public figures of that alteration<br>of minds&#x2014;they had become what are now called in clich� &#x201c;icons,&#x201d; secular saints. They hadn&#x2019;t made the change, but they had helped to midwife the birth.

This volume includes :The 'Gloria Sott'," "The Musgrave Ritual," A Study in Scarlet, "The Adventure of the Speckled Band," "The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet," "The Resident Patient," and "The Reigate Squires."</li></ul><br></p><p>Arthur Conan Doyle's <i>Study in Scarlet</i> is the first published story involving the legendary Sherlock Holmes, arguably the world's best-known detective, and the first narrative by Holmes's Boswell, the unassuming Dr. Watson, a military surgeon lately returned from the Afghan War. Watson needs a flat-mate and a diversion. Holmes needs a foil. And thus a great literary collaboration begins. <p> Watson and Holmes move to a now-famous address, 221B Baker Street, where Watson is introduced to Holmes's eccentricities as well as his uncanny ability to deduce information about his fellow beings. Somewhat shaken by Holmes's egotism, Watson is nonetheless dazzled by his seemingly magical ability to provide detailed information about a man glimpsed once under the streetlamp across the road. </p> <p> Then murder. Facing a deserted house, a twisted corpse with no wounds, a mysterious phrase drawn in blood on the wall, and the buffoons of Scotland Yard--Lestrade and Gregson--Holmes measures, observes, picks up a pinch of this and a pinch of that, and generally baffles his faithful Watson. Later, Holmes explains: "In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backward.... There are few people who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result." Holmes is in that elite group. </p> <p> Conan Doyle quickly learned that it was Holmes's deductions that were of most interest to his readers. The lengthy flashback, while a convention of popular fiction, simply distracted from readers' real focus. It is when Holmes and Watson gather before the coal fire and Holmes sums up the deductions that led him to the successful apprehension of the criminal that we are most captivated. Subsequent Holmes stories--<i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>, <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i>, and <i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i>--rightly plunge the twosome directly into the middle of a baffling crime, piling mystery upon mystery until Holmes's denouement once more leaves the dazzled Watson murmuring, "You are wonderful, Holmes!"

Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.<p> Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? </p><p> But Quidditch buffs need not go into mourning: we get our share of this great game at the World Cup. Attempting to go incognito as Muggles, 100,000 witches and wizards converge on a "nice deserted moor." As ever, Rowling magicks up the details that make her world so vivid, and so comic. Several spectators' tents, for instance, are entirely unquotidian. One is a minipalace, complete with live peacocks; another has three floors and multiple turrets. And the sports paraphernalia on offer includes rosettes "squealing the names of the players" as well as "tiny models of Firebolts that really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which strolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves." Needless to say, the two teams are decidedly different, down to their mascots. Bulgaria is supported by the beautiful veela, who instantly enchant everyone--including Ireland's supporters--over to their side. Until, that is, thousands of tiny cheerleaders engage in some pyrotechnics of their own: "The leprechauns had risen into the air again, and this time, they formed a giant hand, which was making a very rude sign indeed at the veela across the field."</p><p> Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This <i>Daily Prophet</i> scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5. This fan is ready to wager that the author herself is part veela--her pen her wand, her commitment to her world complete.

Arguably, German Americans form America's largest ethnic group. Yet they have a remarkably low profile today, reflecting a dramatic, twentieth-century retreat from German-American identity. In this age of multiculturalism, why have German Americans gone into ethnic eclipse--and where have they ended up? <i>Becoming Old Stock</i> represents the first in-depth exploration of that question. The book describes how German Philadelphians reinvented themselves in the early twentieth century, especially after World War I brought a nationwide anti-German backlash.</p><br><p> Using quantitative methods, oral history, and a cultural analysis of written sources, the book explores how, by the 1920s, many middle-class and Lutheran residents had redefined themselves in "old-stock" terms--as "American" in opposition to southeastern European "new immigrants." It also examines working-class and Catholic Germans, who came to share a common identity with other European immigrants, but not with newly arrived black Southerners.</p><br><br><p> <i>Becoming Old Stock</i> sheds light on the way German Americans used race, American nationalism, and mass culture to fashion new identities in place of ethnic ones. It is also an important contribution to the growing literature on racial identity among European Americans. In tracing the fate of one of America's largest ethnic groups, <i>Becoming Old Stock</i> challenges historians to rethink the phenomenon of ethnic assimilation and to explore its complex relationship to American pluralism.</p></p><p><p>"This is a scholarly work par excellence. Prodigiously researched, cogently argued and extremely well written, the book is a richly detailed case study of the shifts in German-American identity in Philadelphia during the early 20th century.

But what are the sources of these goals and desires? If they arise from ignorance, habitual patterns, and negative emotions�&#x20ac;&#x201d;psychologically destructive elements that actually enslave us�&#x20ac;&#x201d;is the freedom to pursue them true freedom or just a myth? In this book, Ch�gyam Trungpa explores the meaning of freedom in the profound context of Tibetan Buddhism. He shows how our attitudes, preconceptions, and even our spiritual practices can become chains that bind us to repetitive patterns of frustration and despair. He also explains the role of meditation in bringing into focus the causes of frustration and in allowing these negative forces to become aids in advancing toward true freedom. Trungpa's unique ability to express the essence of Buddhist teachings in the language and imagery of contemporary American culture makes this book one of the most immediately available sources for the meaning of the Buddhist doctrine ever written.</p><p>Ch�gyam Trungpa (1940&#x2013;1987)&#x2014;meditation master, teacher, and artist&#x2014;founded Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado, the first Buddhist-inspired university in North America; the Shambhala Training program; and an international association of meditation centers known as Shambhala International.

It offers fresh insight into more than twenty centuries of Greek and Roman history and encompasses a landscape that stretches from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and from the Pillars of Hercules to the banks of the Indus. The authors draw upon a wide range of sources including gravestones, floor plans, papyrus rolls, vase paintings, and literary works to illustrate how representations of women evolved during this age. They journey into the minds of men and bring to light an imaginative history of women and of the relations between the sexes.</p></p><p>In the words of the general editors, A History of Women seeks &#34;to understand women&#39;s place in society, their condition, the roles they played and the powers they possessed, their silence, their speech, and their deeds. It is the variety of the representations of women--as gods, Madonnas, witches, and so on--that we hope to capture, in its permanence as well as its many transformations&#34;. Informed by the work of seventy-five distinguished historians, this five-volume series sets before us an engaging, panoramic chronicle that extends from antiquity to the present day. The inaugural volume brings women from the margins of ancient history into the fore. The authors&#39; deft analysis offers fresh insight into more than twenty centuries of Greek and Roman history and encompasses a landscape that stretches from the North Sea to the Mediterranean and from the Pillars of Hercules to the banks of the Indus. In the minds of the ancients, the roles for which women were destined were silent ones: motherhood and homemaking, tasks relegated to obscurity by scribes who focused exclusively on the deeds of men. Even the census neglected women; in Rome, only heiresses were counted. But the dearth of information about women in official archives and the near absence of writing by women from this era stand in stark contrast to the astonishing profusion of texts and images created by men that are concerned with women and gender. The number of women&#39;s representations is astonishing. The authors draw upon sources ranging from gravestones to floor plans, from stele inscriptions to papyrus rolls, from vase paintings to Greek and Roman literary works, to illustrate how representations of women evolved during thisage. They journey into the minds of men--from the Greeks imagining their goddesses to the Church Fathers inventing the figure of the martyred female saint--and bring to light an imaginative history of women and of the relations between the sexes. The authors explore select aspects of ancient mythology, philosophy, law, and art that illuminate the social position of women and the prevailing attitudes about sexual difference. The social practices that left an indelible mark on women&#39;s lives--practices associated with sexuality and reproduction, property, and religious ritual and priesthood--are fully examined in these pages. The myths of a remote era in which women held the reins of power are put to rest. What emerges is a vital portrait that enriches our understanding of the women of antiquity and enlarges our knowledge of their true roles in the social, religious, economic, and imaginative life of the ancient world. The volume&#39;s elegant prose and superb illustrations will engage and delight both the general reader and the seasoned historian.Georges Duby, a member of the Acad�mie Fran�aise, is Professor of Medieval History at the Coll�ge de France.</p><h2>Famous Paintings</h2><p>This book offers a lavish introduction to 35 of the world&#39;s best-known, best-loved paintings.

We got your test result.&nbsp; And I&#x2019;m really sorry to tell you that it is positive for Ebola.&#x201d;</i></b><br><br> Dr. Kent and Amber Brantly moved with their children to war-torn Liberia in the fall of 2013 to provide medical care for people in great need&#x2014;to help replace hopelessness with hope. When, less than a year later, Kent contracted the deadly Ebola virus, hope became what he and Amber needed too.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Kent received the diagnosis, he was already alone and in quarantine in the Brantly home in Liberia. Amber and the children had left just days earlier on a trip to the United States. Kent&#x2019;s personal battle against the horrific Ebola began, and as thousands of people worldwide prayed for his life, a miraculous series of events unfolded.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Called for Life </i>tells the riveting inside story of Kent and Amber&#x2019;s call to serve their neighbors, as well as Kent&#x2019;s fight for life with Ebola and Amber&#x2019;s&#x2019; struggle to support him from half-a-world away. Most significantly, <i>Called for Life </i>reminds us of the risk, the honor, and the joy to be known when God and others are served without reservation.</p><p>Dr. Kent Brantly, accompanied by his wife Amber and family, served as medical missionaries in Monrovia, Liberia, with World Medical Mission, the medical arm of Samaritan&#x2019;s Purse. Both Kent (BA in Biblical Text) and Amber (BS in Nursing) are graduates of Abilene Christian University.&nbsp; Dr. Brantly received his Medical Degree from Indiana University School of Medicine. He also completed his Family Medicine Residency and Fellowship in Maternal Child Health at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas. After contracting the Ebola virus in summer 2014, Dr. Brantly was evacuated to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, where he recovered and was later reunited with his family. Now serving as the Medical Missions Advisor for Samaritan&#x2019;s Purse, Dr. Brantly, Amber, and their two children are based in Texas.<b>Update for the Paperback Edition</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Liberia was declared Ebola free by the World Health Organization on Janu�ary 14, 2016&#x2014;for the third time. We are thankful this outbreak has come to an end, but much work remains to be done. <br> &nbsp;<br> There are more than seventeen thousand Ebola survivors in West Africa. ELWA hospital is currently one of four centers in Monrovia providing health care for Ebola survivors, helping to manage the lingering effects of the disease and helping the survivors to rebuild their lives in the midst of continuing stigma and rejection by many parts of society. In addition to the huge number of survivors, there are also thousands of individuals widowed or orphaned by Ebola. The gov�ernments of West Africa are struggling to find ways to care for these innocent victims. <br> &nbsp;<br> Samaritan&#x2019;s Purse continues construction on a new hospital at ELWA, pro�jected to open by the end of summer 2016. (To learn more about this project, visit SamaritansPurse.org.) Work also continues in the development of methods for the prevention and treatment of Ebola Virus Disease. <br> &nbsp;<br> In the time since the initial release of this book, many opportunities have been granted us to share our story before national and international leaders, aid workers, health-care professionals, college students, and faith groups. This has taken us around the globe, but perhaps the most meaningful journey of all was the trip our family took back to Liberia. <br> &nbsp;<br> In June 2015, the four of us made the long journey over the ocean to visit old friends and see familiar places in Liberia. The time was too short, but the experi�ence brought healing and closure to an intense chapter in our family&#x2019;s story. <br> &nbsp;<br> We listened to our friends and coworkers tell how they have been affected by the Ebola outbreak. It was heart wrenching to see the pain in their faces as they recounted the stories of family members who had suffered and died in the Ebola treatment unit. We were struck by how grateful they all seemed to be, despite the circumstances and their deep grief; they all thanked God for getting them through. <br> &nbsp;<br> We may never again live in our little house on the beach at ELWA, but we have been forever changed by our experiences and relationships there.<br> &nbsp;<br> Kent has since reentered full-time medical practice in Fort Worth, Texas. He is working in the hospital system where he trained, taking care of patients and teaching family-medicine residents in advanced obstetrical care. <br> &nbsp;<br> Amber volunteers in our children&#x2019;s school and for World Relief Fort Worth as it helps to resettle refugees in new homes. She is also involved with women&#x2019;s min�istries at our home church.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of the proceeds from the sale of this book have been given to the Pan-African Academy of Christian Surgeons in memory of Dr. Sarah Lantz. Dr. Lantz was Kent&#x2019;s medical-school classmate and a fellow Samaritan&#x2019;s Purse Post-Resident physician who worked in Zambia from January 2014 to August 2015, when she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer.

Though this Ebola outbreak is now part of history, the lessons learned through that crisis are still with us. There will be other disease outbreaks and other international disasters, such as the earthquakes in Nepal, the war in Syria, and the refugee crisis in the Middle East. And in all these situations, we must remember the lessons we learned through these events: we must choose compassion over fear. <br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Prologue</b><br> <b>So What&#x2019;s Next?<br></b><br> Kent, bud. We got your test result. And I&#x2019;m really sorry to tell you that it is positive for Ebola.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I had not expected to hear those words despite the mounting evidence over the past three days&#x2014;the worsening symptoms, the repeated negative malaria tests&#x2014;that would have led me to suspect Ebola had I been the doctor rather than the patient.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our first Ebola patient had come to our hospital in Monrovia, Liberia, barely six weeks earlier. But we had worked under the strain of a looming Ebola outbreak for nearly three anxious months before then. For the thirty-eight years since Ebola Virus Disease had been identified, every outbreak had been limited to small rural communities.<br> &nbsp;<br> This time, however, was different. This time, Ebola had found the perfect storm of factors, quickly spreading through three countries and into major urban centers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our hospital of forty-five to fifty beds hurriedly converted the chapel into a small isolation unit, hoping it would never be needed. When our first Ebola pa�tient arrived, we maintained the only treatment unit in all of southern Liberia.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the beginning stages of what erupted into the worst Ebola outbreak the world has ever seen, I had learned to consider Ebola anytime a patient entered our emergency room with a fever and symptoms that, just a few months earlier, would have been suspected as likely malaria or typhoid fever. In fact, for the safety of our medical workers, we treated all febrile patients as though they had Ebola until proven otherwise. It was too risky not to. <br> &nbsp;<br> The Ebola strain we observed carried a mortality rate of 70 percent. The death rate was even higher in our hospital, where only one of the dozens of patients who had tested positive for Ebola had survived. <br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>One. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Ebola didn&#x2019;t just kill our patients; it stripped them of their dignity. Ebola hu�miliated its victims by taking away control of their bodily functions. We con�stantly changed diapers and sheets and cleaned up patients, and we fed them when they could no longer do so themselves. <br> &nbsp;<br> Unable to cure their disease, we focused on treating their sense of isolation that came from being in a treatment unit where only two groups of people were allowed inside. One group was the medical personnel always working with their own safety in the front of their minds in light of the disproportionate number of health-care workers contracting the disease. The second group was other Ebola patients, moaning and groaning in pain until their bodies could fight no longer. <br> &nbsp;<br> For all but that one patient, a positive Ebola test had become a death sentence served out among suffering patients and cautious medical personnel&#x2014;some un�known foreigners, even&#x2014;outfitted so securely that only our eyes were visible through the protective goggles. <br> &nbsp;<br> No families. No friends. No familiar faces. No human contact. <br> &nbsp;<br> With no cure, no hope. <br> &nbsp;<br> As the outbreak had worsened and our hospital worked to expand our capac�ity, I was named director of the treatment unit. I became the physician who en�sured that our staff was properly trained, repeatedly reassuring them that when we followed the protocols and worked together as a team, we were completely safe. The staff had trusted me too, because for each of my patients, I had determined to display compassion over fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> And now Dr. Lance Plyler, the team leader responsible for managing our medical response to Ebola, was standing outside my bedroom window, because he could not come into my contaminated home, notifying me that I, too, had contracted the virus. Dr. John Fankhauser, my colleague and mentor in Liberia for nine busy months, stood beside my bed dressed in full personal protective equip�ment (PPE), just as I had stood beside the beds of too many patients in our Ebola unit, because he wanted to be with me when Lance delivered the news.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I really wish you hadn&#x2019;t said that,&#x201d; I told Lance.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was so sick at that point that I don&#x2019;t remember saying those words; that is Lance&#x2019;s recollection of my reaction. But I do remember what I said immediately after.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, so what is next? What&#x2019;s our plan? What are we going to do?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I am a doctor, trained to respond to a bad test result by creating a plan. More importantly, I am a husband and a father, and my thoughts turned to my beautiful wife and children back home in the United States. I might not see them, much less touch them, ever again.<br> &nbsp;<br> I stared out our bedroom window, looking to Lance.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How am I going to tell Amber?&#x201d;<br> <b><br>Crisis<br></b><br> <b>Chapter 1</b><br> <b>Defenseless<br></b><br> <b>Kent</b><br> <i>This is it. Everything is about to change.</i><br> Our first Ebola patient looked up at me weakly as I knelt next to her bed of blankets on the patio near the hospital pharmacy. The disease we had prepared for while praying we would never see it had, indeed, arrived at our hospital, and I realized I was about to set the tone for the rest of our time treating Ebola patients&#x2014;however long that might prove to be.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dressed in full protective gear, I offered the young woman my right hand protected by two surgical gloves. She grabbed hold.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Felicia, my name is Dr. Brantly,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;This is David. He&#x2019;s one of our nurses.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> David greeted her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We are going to take good care of you here,&#x201d; I assured Felicia.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was Wednesday night, June 11, 2014. Our hospital had the only Ebola treat�ment unit in Liberia&#x2019;s capital city of Monrovia, and the phone call had come earlier in the evening from the country&#x2019;s Ministry of Health. Two suspected Ebola pa�tients were being transferred to us from a hospital in the northern suburb of New Kru Town.<br> &nbsp;<br> Three members of a family had died in the past week, and Ebola was the suspected cause. Two other family members had become sick and were at that hospital. As we began preparing our Ebola treatment unit, which had been sitting empty for months, we did not know when to expect the two.<br> &nbsp;<br> We were not even sure they would actually come to us.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nancy Writebol came in to help. Nancy, personnel director for Serving In Mission (SIM) missionaries in Liberia, had volunteered to serve as the unit&#x2019;s hygienist when we ramped up our Ebola response. Nancy changed the sheets on the beds and mixed a sufficient quantity of the bleach-water solution for decontamination.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. Debbie Eisenhut (known as Dr. Debbie) volunteered to stay at the hospital and said she would call me at home if anything developed. A little later, Debbie did call, telling me an ambulance had arrived at the hospital with two patients, a man in his midforties and his niece. I returned to the hospital.<br> &nbsp;<br> As our two patients waited outside in the ambulance, we had to recruit two staff members willing to be the first to risk their lives to work in the unit with our first Ebola patients. I did not expect anyone to <i>want </i>to sign up.<br> &nbsp;<br> I pleaded with some of the nurses: &#x201c;Look, this is somebody&#x2019;s sister, somebody&#x2019;s mother, somebody&#x2019;s daughter. Somebody&#x2019;s uncle, somebody&#x2019;s brother, somebody&#x2019;s cousin. We&#x2019;ve got to take care of them. Think if this was your family member.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Our medical director at ELWA, Dr. Jerry Brown, joined in recruiting nurses by phone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Two volunteered for the job: Louise, an ER nurse, and David, a nurse&#x2019;s aide.<br> &nbsp;<br> Preparing the unit, assembling the staff, and getting the four of us dressed in PPE required a couple of hours. Debbie made several trips outside to the ambu�lance during that span. Each time Debbie went outside, she told everyone to re�main near the ambulance and not to get out to walk around or enter the hospital until we came to get them.<br> &nbsp;<br> There were no ambulance services in Monrovia. The only ambulances were owned by hospitals and the government for transporting patients from one hospital to another. An ambulance was typically a modified Land Cruiser with sideways-facing seats in the back. The crew sat in the front seat with no divider between them and the patient or patients in the back.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ambulance outside our hospital contained three crew members, the two patients, and two family members&#x2014;a man in his thirties and a boy who appeared to be twelve.<br> &nbsp;<br> As we were preparing the unit, the uncle, who had been alert and talking, became very still and silent. The two family members helped Felicia climb down out of the ambulance and lie on the asphalt road behind it.<br> &nbsp;<br> One of Felicia&#x2019;s relatives then grew angry at having to wait and stormed the entrance to the emergency room, kicking a hole in the door. He accused us of delaying care for Felicia and not being willing to admit her.<br> &nbsp;<br> We tried to convince the family that we were not ignoring them, that we were preparing the best we could to take care of Felicia the right way and safely. He calmed down and returned to the ambulance.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then it began raining. I do not know if Felicia walked or if she was carried, but they moved her to a covered porch in front of the hospital pharmacy and spread blankets there for her to lie on.<br> &nbsp;<br> After we had the inside of the unit fully prepared, David and I suited up in PPE and approached Felicia on the porch. As I dropped to one knee beside her, the burden of the moment descended squarely on my shoulders, because I had known all along that once the first case arrived, working and living in Monrovia would never be the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have a stretcher,&#x201d; I told Felicia, &#x201c;and we are going to put you on the stretcher and carry you to a place we have prepared for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I looked up at David. &#x201c;Do you want her head or feet?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Feet,&#x201d; he replied.<br> &nbsp;<br> I picked Felicia up by the shoulders, and we slid her onto the stretcher and placed the blankets on top of her. We carried her around the back of the hospital and into the isolation unit.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. Debbie and Louise were waiting for her inside. I picked up a spray can of the chlorine solution and walked back around the hospital to the ambulance. Felicia&#x2019;s uncle remained curled up inside the ambulance, lying over the top of a backpack. I leaned into the truck and felt for a pulse, then looked him over. He was obviously deceased.<br> &#x201c;I have to have that backpack,&#x201d; the man with him said. &#x201c;It has my identification card in it.&#x201d;<br> I pulled the backpack out from under the uncle. The body fell onto the floor of the ambulance, his position unchanged. He still looked as though he were lying over the backpack. Rigor mortis had already set in.<br> I stood there, backpack in hand, facing a decision.<br> I could not give a backpack contaminated with Ebola to the man. But on the other hand, he had already been exposed, having ridden in the back of the ambulance and having taken care of the uncle and Felicia. I handed him the backpack.<br> The young boy started crying.<br> &#x201c;Stop crying!&#x201d; the man scolded him.<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay for him to cry,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You may be used to being around death, but he is twelve years old. He has lost four family members in a week. It&#x2019;s okay for him to be scared and to cry.&#x201d;<br> I sprayed bleach on the ...</p><h2>Remembering Woolworth&#39;s: A Nostalgic History of the World&#39;s Most Famous Five-and-Dime</h2><p>Millions of Americans have fond memories of shopping at Woolworth's, wandering the aisles in search of a humble spool Woolco thread, festive Christmas decorations, a goldfish or parakeet, or a blue bottle of Evening in Paris perfume. And who could forget the special treat of grilled-cheese sandwich or ice-cream sundae at the famous lunch counter?<br><br>These and countless other memories are celebrated in<i> Remembering Woolworth's</i>. Packed with photos, first-hand remembrances, vivid anecdotes, and a lively, well-researched narrative, the book tells the story of how a poor potato farmer named Frank Woolworth created a merchandising empire that touched the lives of Americans in small towns, big cities, and everywhere in between. Chapters cover the store's humble beginnings, surviving the Great Depression, the civil rights sit-ins, Woolworth's around the globe, the popularity of Woolworth's collectibles, and much more.<br></p><p>In our age of nationwide discount retailers, <i>Remembering Woolworth's: A Nostalgic History of the World's Most Famous Five-and-Dime</i> provides an entertaining look back at one of retail's most successful pioneers, F.W.&nbsp;Woolworth, and his empire of department stores that defined the shopping experience for millions over the course of its 118-year existence. Woolworth, considered by his first boss to be the "worst salesman in the world," overcame repeated failure and financial hardship to open his first store in 1879 in Lancaster City, Pennsylvania. Through trial and error, the young Woolworth learned that selling large quantities of low-priced merchandise led to profit. Insightfully, Woolworth made his customers feel "rich"--and generated immense customer loyalty by offering products at affordable, nickel-and-dime prices. The Woolworth Building in lower Manhattan, the tallest in the world upon its completion in 1913, embodied the strength of the retail empire that, at its peak, consisted of over 10,000 stores worldwide. The corporation was eventually sold in 1997.<p> <i>Remembering Woolworth's</i> combines personal testimony, black-and-white and color photos, and period graphics to create a friendly, scrapbook feel. Karen Plunkett-Powell adeptly explores the personal and professional sides of F.W.&nbsp;Woolworth and the success of his "Red-Fronts" both domestically and abroad. She is at her best, however, in recapturing the particulars of the Woolworth shopping experience: the counter girls, seasonal traditions, collectibles, and lunch counters. At times historically light and colloquial, <i>Remembering Woolworth's</i> nevertheless brings back to life one of retail's most influential entrepreneurs and one of the world's most endearing department stores. <i>--Bertina Loeffler-Sedlack</i></p>Karen Plunkett-Powel is the author of <i>The Nancy Drew Scrapbook </i>and the coauthor of <i>Home Design from the Inside-Out</i>.

Author Doug George-Kanentiio is a Mohawk now living in Oneida Territory who is actively involved in issues affecting the Confederacy and has been writing about developments in Indian Country; for the past decade. Informative, provocative, and challenging, this book provides a refreshing insider's view of Indian peoples whose concerns continue to have major significance for the Northeast and whose future will affect Native Americans throughout the United States.<br><br>The author offers a portrait of the Iroquois that touches on a multitude of topics, beginning with Iroquois beliefs concerning their origins as a people and their spiritual, communal, and family traditions. He offers an Iroquois viewpoint on issues that are vital to the Six Nations' economic and cultural survival, including education, taxation, land-claims, treaty rights, crime, gambling, and relations with state and federal governments. Stories of Iroquois leaders and heroes include historical figures such as Handsome Lake, as well as elders whom the author has known personally.</p><p>Doug George-Kanentiio was born and raised in the Akwesasne Mohawk Territory. An award-winning columnist, he has served as advisor, producer, and script-writer for national television documentaries on Iroquois subjects. He edited the international news journal Akwesasne Notes from 1986 to 1992 and since 1991 has been writing regular columns for the Syracuse Herald America and News from Indian Country. He served for 7 years as one of the land claims negotiators for the Mohawk Nation Council of Chiefs. A member of the Board of Trustees of the National Museum of the American Indian, he is the chairperson of its Collections and Acquisitions Committee. Doug George-Kanentiio resides in Oneida Territory with his wife Joanne Shenandoah.These books provide current commentary and thought on Iroquois-United States relationships from the perspective of key leaders within the Iroquois Nations. These relationships are framed in terms of Iroquois cultural mores and traditions and the importance of personal honor and trustworthiness. George-Kanentiio, a journalist and member of the board of trustees of the National Museum of the American Indian, provides a detailed opinion and history of family values, spiritual and traditional knowledge, politics and sovereignty, natural law, and traditional spiritual and political leaders within the Iroquois Nations. He also initiates a critical dialog about and provides background for understanding previous treaties and Iroquois views of these documents. The Treaty of Canandaigua provides a tightly focused examination of one of the most important treaties between the United States and the Iroquois Confederacy. In accord with the Treaty of Canandaigua, signed in 1794, the various Iroquois Nations of the Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, Seneca, Tuscarora, and Cayuga were observed to have full legal title to their lands. This treaty was formalized by President George Washington and ratified by Congress. This book represents a forum for Iroquois scholars and leaders to speak candidly about a number of issues related to treaty politics, treaty relations, and sovereignty. The bulk of the text is in the form of addresses, speeches, and essaysAa number of which commemorate the treaty and what it has symbolized to the Iroquois. Ironically, even after more than 200 years of neglect and U.S. abuse of the treaty, the Iroquois see it as one of their best hopes for retaining sovereignty and establishing strong moral and legal claims to traditional tribal lands. The sentiment and views expressed by George-Kanentiio blend elegantly with these pieces, serving as an excellent reference point for understanding the latter. Both books fill a definite need for written expressions of traditional Native American views and impressions regarding over 200 years of political interaction with Europeans and Americans in North America. Both books also serve as an important and critical vantage point concerning sovereignty and self-determinism among indigenous populations.AJohn E. Dockall, Bernice P.

During his imprisonment, he wrote most of the poems that have earned him the reputation as the greatest poet of the Christian mystical tradition. The poems, presented here in a beautifully printed, lightly illustrated Spanish/English edition, often blur the line between romantic and religious love, in the tradition of Song of Songs. "On a Dark Night," for example, begins with a lover whose gender is not identified, stealing out of a house, down a secret ladder, following "my only light and guide / the light that burned in my heart," to find "the one I knew would come, / where surely no one would find us." The poem ends with a breathtaking image of spiritual and sensual contentment: "On the ramparts / while I sat ruffling his hair / the air struck my neck / with its gentle hand, / leaving my senses suspended. / I stayed; I surrendered, / resting my face on my Beloved. / Nothing mattered. / I left my cares / forgotten among the lilies." These are poems to read aloud to a lover, poems to read silently before God, poems that quiver before the world's beauty and thankfully seek to describe something beyond it--a God whose undeniable intimacy with humanity always edges toward the ineffable. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p>San Juan de la Cruz, the great sixteenth-century Spanish mystic, is regarded by many as Spain&#39;s finest poet. Passionate, ecstatic, and spiritual, his poems are a blend of exquisite lyricism and profound mystical thought. In The Poems of St. John of the Cross, John Frederick Nims presents his superlative translation of the complete poems, re-creating the lyrical fervor of St. John&#39;s art.</p><h2>Naamah&#39;s Curse</h2><p>Jacqueline Carey, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Kushiel's Legacy series, delivers book two in her new lushly imagined trilogy featuring daughter of Alba, Moirin.<br><br>NAAMAH'S CURSE<br><br>Far from the land of her birth, Moirin sets out across Tatar territory to find Bao, the proud and virile Ch'in fighter who holds the missing half of her <i>diadh-anam,</i> the divine soul-spark of her mother's people. After a long ordeal, she not only succeeds, but surrenders to a passion the likes of which she's never known. But the lovers' happiness is short lived, for Bao is entangled in a complication that soon leads to their betrayal.</p><p>Jacqueline Carey's previous publications include various short stories, essays, a nonfiction book, <em>Angels: Celestial Spirits in Legend and Art</em>, as well as the nationally bestselling series Kushiel's Legacy.Still chasing her destiny in the sequel to Naamah's Kiss (2009), Moirin follows the urging of her diadh-anam across Tatar territory, looking for Bao, her Ch'in lover, who holds the other half of her divine soul-spark. She finds him married to the Great Khan's daughter, and their plans to smooth this wrinkle go disastrously wrong when the Great Khan arranges to have Moirin kidnapped by fanatical, pious Vralians, while Bao is led into the lands of the Spider Queen. Though this book is packed with new people, new lands, and new gods, the pacing is slow and the tone reflective. Carey's involving depictions of several religions also grow rather pointed. While Bao is never present long enough to gain depth, Moirin grows in strength and compassion, confronting several interesting crossroads in her faith and her way of life. Despite a &#x201c;middle book&#x201d; feel, series fans will love it, and an ominous warning about Raphael de Merliot, whom Moirin must &#x201c;reckon with,&#x201d; gives us something to look forward to in the next book. --Krista Hutley</p><h2>M.I.

This book is a treasure. You have reminded us and called us back to the vision of marriage reflecting God's character, especially his unconditional love and grace. Regrettably, guilt-ridden performance has replaced this lofty vision. Although it is good to know and apply helpful relational skills in marriage, if they are not baptized in God's grace they become pathways to frustration.

Margaret Wise Brown&#39;s simple, poetic language brought to life by Floyd Cooper&#39;s spectacular paintings offer a fresh perspective on the Holy Family and the miraculous birth of Christ.</p><p>Margaret Wise Brown wrote hundreds of books and stories during her life, but she is best known for Goodnight Moon and Runaway Bunny. Even though she died over 45 years ago, her books still sell very well. Margaret loved animals. Most of her books have animals as characters in the story. She liked to write books that had a rhythm to them. Sometimes she would put a hard word into the story or poem. She thought this made children think harder when they are reading. She wrote all the time. There are many scraps of paper where she quickly wrote down a story idea or a poem. She said she dreamed stories and then had to write them down in the morning before she forgot them. She tried to write the way children wanted to hear a story, which often isn&#39;t the same way an adult would tell a story. She also taught illustrators to draw the way a child saw things. One time she gave two puppies to someone who was going to draw a book with that kind of dog. The illustrator painted many pictures one day and then fell asleep. When he woke up, the papers he painted on were bare. The puppies had licked all the paint off the paper. Margaret died after surgery for a bursting appendix while n France. She had many friends who still miss her. They say she was a creative genius who made a room come to life with her excitement. Margaret saw herself as something else - a writer of songs and nonsense.</p><h2>Handke Plays: 1: Offending the Audience, Self-Accusation, Kaspar, My Foot My Tutor, The Ride Across Lake Constance, and They Are Dying Out (Contemporary Dramatists Series)</h2><p><p> <i>Offending the Audience</i>: "A dissection of our expectations about what ought to happen in the theatre."�&#x20ac;&#x201d;<i>Observer</i></p><p> <i>Self-Accusation</i>: "A cunning and ironic attack on bureaucratic moral guilt."�&#x20ac;&#x201d;<i>Observer </i></p><p> <i>Kaspar</i> is based on the true story of Kaspar Hauser, a sixteen year old boy who appeared from nowhere in Nuremberg in 1828 and who had to be taught to speak from scratch.

The essays are often reflections on the themes of myth and folklore: The Heroic Quest, The Black Sheep, The Foolish Young Son, drawing on a lifelong immersion in world mythology. Ranging from Hindu creation stories through Celtic legend and the &#34;Dreamtime&#34; of the Australian Aborigines to Central European tales of wicked fairies and miller&#39;s daughters, the author sets out her faith in the poetic truth of these fables. Interspersed are memories of her Australian childhood, of the friendships she formed as a young woman in Ireland with AE and Yeats and of her stay on an American Indian reservation where she was driven about by a surly cowboy.</p><p>&#34;The Sphinx, the Pyramids, the stone temples are, all of them, ultimately, as flimsy as London Bridge; our cities but tents set up in the cosmos.

Now he has compiled a complete guide to survival in the urban jungle. Every year in America there are thousands of fatal accidents in the home&#x2014;more than on the roads, and many more than in the great outdoors. Fire, electricity, water, gas, sharp knives, poisons, chemicals&#x2014;these valuable tools can quickly become dangerous weapons when not treated with proper respect and understanding. Add to these the risks of travel, terrorism, muggings, rape, tsunamis, and earthquakes. We are constantly reminded that the world is a dangerous place. Wiseman shows readers how to think realistically and practically about these perils in order to avoid them, whether they are at home, on the street, in school, or in transit. From self-defense techniques to home security systems to coping with natural disasters, this book will teach readers to recognize risks, make quick decisions, and live confidently in the modern urban world. 100 color illustrations</p><p>With the clarity, common sense, and directness you would expect from the SAS&#x2019;s former Chief Survival Instructor, Lofty Wiseman shares the skills he&#x2019;s perfected over a long career. <b>The SAS Urban Survival Handbook</b> shows you strategies and techniques for: combating the problems and stresses of urban life for you and your family; making and keeping your home safe; avoiding accidents and injury from tools, chemicals, and poisonous plants; insuring home security; dealing with travel dangers; combating threats from letter bombs, hijack, and kidnap; and coping with natural disasters.

When her husband is assigned to a larger and more demanding community in the Florida panhandle, Dean becomes fast friends with Augusta Holderfield, a woman whose good looks and extravagant habits immediately entrance her. As their friendship evolves, Augusta challenges Dean to break free from her traditional role as the preacher&#39;s wife. Just as Dean is questioning everything she has always valued, a tragedy occurs, providing the catalyst for change in ways she never could have imagined.</p><p><strong>Cassandra King</strong> is the author of <em>The Sunday Wife</em>, <em>The Same Sweet Girls</em> and <em>Queen of Broken Hearts</em>. A native of Lower Alabama, she lives in the Low Country of South Carolina with her husband, novelist Pat Conroy.Audiophiles should run to their nearest libraries or booksellers for this outstanding recording. Laura Hicks delivers King's insightful novel with warmth, humor, and a dash of Southern charm. She interprets the upbeat and down-in-the-mouth emotions of minister's wife Dean Lynch in a plainspoken tongue and lends an appropriately glorified tone to Dean's husband and the other ministers. Listeners will laugh aloud at Hicks's depictions of the adversarial, yet just-too-sweet Libby and Vanna Fay. When Sylvia Hiney Whiney speaks, those who listen while driving should pull over. Hicks characterizes a diverse group of other Floridians, including a young boy, a stroke victim, and a Romanian fortune-teller, with believable vocalizations. She portrays this powerful story of love, loss, and growth in a remarkable way. J.J.B.

But that is just what McMillan has so artfully done in this picture-book version of the poem. In an inventive blend of layout and design, he meshes the old and new together. The delicate endpapers and old-fashioned edgings to the photographs all serve as the proper background for the black, bespectacled young girl who is the model for Mary and the real coup of the book. This is a Mary who goes to school in an old-fashioned building, but with a male teacher. With her bright smile and yellow overalls, she is sure to connect with children meeting Mary for the first time. Mary has been portrayed elsewhere, such as in the picture-book version by Tomie dePaola (Holiday, 1984) as a lovely old-fashioned figure complete with pinafore and ringlets. McMillan has proven that this is no longer a universal portrayal. The fine design and excellent color scheme as well as the afterword, original poem, and explanations about the book make this a wonderfully crafted book that no library should miss. --Jane Marino, White Plains Pub .

These hinterlands are the homeland of Ruso's slave, Tilla, who has scores of her own to settle there: Her tribespeople are fomenting a rebellion against Roman control, and her former lover is implicated in the grisly murder of a soldier. Ruso, filling in for the demented local doctor, is appalled to find that Tilla is still spending time with the prime suspect. Worse, he is honor-bound to try to prove the man innocent&#x2015;and the army wrong&#x2015;by finding another culprit. Soon both Ruso's and Tilla's lives are in <br>jeopardy, as is the future of their burgeoning romance.</p><p>Terra Incognita shines light on a remote corner of the ancient world, where Ruso's luck is running short&#x2015;again.</p></p><p><p><b>Ruth Downie</b> is the bestselling author of <i>Medicus</i>. She is a part-time librarian and lives in Milton Keynes, England, with her husband and two sons.</p>Ruso, a medic with ancient Rome's army, reluctantly gets involved in the investigation when the headless body of a centurion is found near his outpost in Brittania. The case could prove deadly for Ruso when his slave, Tilla, turns out to be an old flame of the prime suspect. Simon Vance gives Ruso a voice that combines conceit, genuine concern, and growing frustration, while making a large cast of characters instantly recognizable. Vance balances Downie's modern wit and her meticulously reconstructed Roman setting. As Ruso juggles murder, political considerations, and a shifting relationship with Tilla, strong characters and Vance's lively reading make this a delight.

It offers close examination of battlefield victories, personal torments, military genius, Bonaparte&#x2032;s titanic ego and his relationships with the French government, Talleyrand, Wellington and Josephine. A consummate biography of a complex man.</p></p><p>You won&#39;t come away from this energetic biography thinking much of the French emperor either as a man or as a general. Historian Alan Schom depicts Napoleon (1769-1821) as a cold-hearted manipulator: Schom&#39;s blistering accounts of the 1798-99 Egyptian campaign and the disastrous 1812 retreat from Russia show the French army decimated due to its leader&#39;s failure to inform himself about the lands he was invading or to properly plan for provisioning his troops. The fun of this book comes from vigorous prose that vividly evokes Bonaparte&#39;s titanic personality and the colorful band of schemers surrounding him.Alan Schom is a Fellow at the Hoover Institution and has lectured on French History at Oxford University.

Conducted by a team of world-acknowledged experts, who provide the most up-to-date information available, it&#39;s the perfect mix of artistic brilliance and scholarly research. The Valley of the Kings and the tombs of the nobles are, together with the pyramids of Giza, among the world&#39;s most visited and best-known sites. Although millions come each year to gaze upon these ancient wonders, a significant portion of this remarkable place remains unseen by most. For the first time, an illuminating and spectacularly produced guide brings together both the artistic and the architectural features of the tombs and maps them out fully. The only photographer granted full access to the site over the past decade provides unrivaled color images of the funerary temples and private necropolises, and in addition, an exploration of their structures and embellishments features plans, photos, drawings of motifs, and hieroglyphs. To complete the presentation: walking itineraries in the Theban mountains, shown from many unusual vantage points.

Weeks (Egyptology, American Univ., Cairo), who discovered the tomb of the sons of Rameses II, as described in his The Lost Tomb (LJ 10/1/98), has assembled an international team of experts to interpret for the nonspecialist the wonders of the Theban necropolis on the west bank of the Nile opposite modern Luxor. Unlike John Romer's recently reprinted popular classic Valley of the Kings, the title in this case is somewhat misleading since, in addition to the most significant tombs in the Valley of the Kings, the survey similarly covers the Valley of the Queens, the royal valley mortuary temples, and the tombs of the nobles, all dating to the New Kingdom (ca. 1570-1070 B.C.E.). The large trim size gives best advantage to the more than 800 incomparable color illustrations, some on fold-out pages. Plans and cutaway reconstructions help orient the reader for an exciting virtual tour. The bibliography is scholarly but also contains popular titles.

On the east bank, beneath the modern city of Luxor, lie the remains of an ancient town that from 1500 to 1000 B.C. was one of the most spectacular in Egypt, with a population of perhaps 50,000. Within it the Egyptians built the huge temple complexes of Karnak and Luxor, two of the largest religious structures ever constructed. On the west bank lies the Theban necropolis, in which archaeologists have found thousands of tombs, scores of temples, and a multitude of houses, villages, shrines, monasteries, and work stations. This profusely illustrated, oversize book contains more than 800 pictures of this prodigious site. The illustrations include archeological reconstruction drawings and six gatefolds. The text, by 14 leading Egyptologists, offers a concise history of the site. For readers interested in this remarkable civilization, this book is the next best thing to being there. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Daniel Coyle is the Sunday Times bestselling author of Lance Armstrong: Tour de Force. He lives with his wife and four children in Homer, Alaska, and Cleveland Heights, Ohio.As a bike racer, over time you develop the skill of keeping a poker face. No matter how extreme a sensation you feel&#x2014;no matter how close you are to cracking&#x2014;you do everything in your power to mask it. This matters in racing, when hiding your true condition from your opponents is a key to success, since it discourages them from attacking. Feel paralyzing pain? Look relaxed, even bored. Can&#x2019;t breathe? Close your mouth. About to die? Smile.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve got a pretty good poker face; Lance has a great one. But there&#x2019;s one guy who&#x2019;s better than either of us: Johan Bruyneel. And it was never so well used as that night at the end of the 2000 Dauphin�, when he told me about the plans for the blood transfusion. I&#x2019;d heard about transfusions before, but it was always theoretical and distant&#x2014;as in, can you believe that some guys actually bank their blood, then put it back in before a race? It seemed weird, Frankenstein- ish, something for Iron Curtain Olympic androids in the eighties. But Johan, when he explained the plan during the Dauphin�, made it sound normal, even boring. He&#x2019;s good at making the outrageous sound normal&#x2014;it might be his greatest skill. It&#x2019;s something in his expression, in the certainty of his big Belgian voice, in the supremely casual way he shrugs while laying out the details of the plan. Whenever I watch the likable gangsters on <i>The Sopranos, </i>I think of Johan.<br> <br>As Johan explained it, Lance, Kevin, and I would fly to Valencia. We would donate a bag of blood, which would be stored, and we&#x2019;d fl y home the next day. Then, at a key point during the Tour, we&#x2019;d put the bag back in, and we&#x2019;d get a boost. It would be like taking EPO, except better: there were rumors of an EPO test being developed for the 2000 Olympics, and word was, they might be using the test during the Tour. I listened to Johan, nodded, gave him my poker face. When I told Haven about it, she gave me the poker face right back (wives get good at it, too). But part of me was thinking, <i>What the hell?</i><br> <br>Maybe that&#x2019;s why I was late the Tuesday morning we left for Valencia. There was no reason to be late&#x2014;everybody knew Lance despised lateness above all things&#x2014;but on that crucial morning we were running late by a full ten minutes. I raced our little Fiat through the narrow streets of Villefranche; Haven was hanging on to the oh-shit bars, asking me to slow down. I kept speeding up. It was eight miles to the airport in Nice. During the trip, my cell phone rang three times. Lance.<br> <i><br>Dude, where are you?</i><br> <i>What&#x2019;s going on? We&#x2019;re about to take off.</i><br> <i>How fast can that fucking car of yours go? Come on!</i><br> <br>We screeched into the airport parking lot; I walked through the security area and onto the runway. I&#x2019;d never been on a private jet before, so I took in the scene: the leather seats, the television, the little fridge, the steward asking me if I would like anything to drink.<br> <br>Lance acted casual, as if private jets were routine&#x2014;which for him, they were. He&#x2019;d been riding them fairly constantly since the previous July, courtesy of Nike, Oakley, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the other corporations who were competing for the privilege of ferrying him around. The numbers were unbelievable. <i>USA Today </i>estimated Lance&#x2019;s income at $7.5 million, he was getting paid $100,000 per speech, and his new memoir, <i>It&#x2019;s Not About the Bike</i>, was an instant best seller. You could feel the flow of money, the new possibilities it opened. Now we didn&#x2019;t have to drive to Valencia. We didn&#x2019;t have to worry about customs or airport security. The jet, like everything else, was now part of our tool box.<br> <br>The engines revved, the wheels went up, and we were airborne. Below, we could see the C�te d&#x2019;Azur, the mansions, the yachts; it felt surreal, like a fantasy world. In the plane, my lateness was forgiven. Lance was confident, happy, excited, and it was contagious. The confident feeling increased when we landed in Valencia and were met on the runway by the Postal team: Johan, Pepe Mart�, and del Moral. They showed up with sandwiches, <i>bocadillos</i>&#x2014;it was important to have a little something in our stomachs beforehand.<br> <br>From the airport, we drove south for half an hour through a marshland as Johan and del Moral talked about the transfusion. It would be so simple, they said. So easy. Extremely safe, nothing at all to worry about. I noticed Johan talked more to Kevin and me than to Lance, and that Lance didn&#x2019;t seem to pay attention; I got the feeling this wasn&#x2019;t Lance&#x2019;s first transfusion.<br> <br>We pulled up near the village of Les Gavines at a beached whale of a hotel called the Sidi Saler, luxurious and quiet, free of the tourists who&#x2019;d be arriving later in summer. We&#x2019;d already been checked in; we took the elevator up to the fifth floor, moving through the deserted hallways. Kevin and I were directed into one room facing the parking lot; Lance got his own room next door.<br> <br>I had expected to see a sophisticated medical setup, but this looked more like a junior- high science experiment: a blue soft- sided cooler, a few clear plastic IV bags, cotton balls, some clear tubing, and a sleek digital scale. Del Moral took over.<br> <i><br>Lie on the bed, roll up your sleeve, give me your arm. Relax.</i><br> <br>He tied a blue elastic band below my biceps, set an empty transfusion bag on a white towel on the floor next to the bed, and wiped the inside of my elbow with an alcohol swab. Then the needle. I&#x2019;d seen a lot of needles, but this one was huge&#x2014;about the size and shape of a coffee stirrer. It was attached to a syringe that was in turn attached to clear tubing that led to the waiting bag, with a small white thumb wheel to control flow. I looked away; felt the needle go in. When I looked again, my blood was pumping steadily into the bag on the floor.<br> <br>You often hear &#x201c;blood transfusion&#x201d; tossed around in the same breath as &#x201c;EPO&#x201d; or &#x201c;testosterone,&#x201d; as if it&#x2019;s all equivalent. Well, it&#x2019;s not. With the other stuff, you swallow a pill or put on a patch or get a tiny injection. But here you&#x2019;re watching a big clear plastic bag slowly fill up with your warm dark red blood. You never forget it.<br> <br>I looked over to see Kevin hooked up in the same way. We could see our reflections on the closet-door mirror. We tried to cut the tension by comparing the speed with which our respective bags were filling: <i>Why are you going so slow? I&#x2019;m dropping you, dude. </i>Johan shuttled between the rooms, checking on us, making small talk.<br> <br>Every so often Pepe or del Moral would kneel down and take the bag in their hands, tilting it gently back and forth, mixing it with anticoagulant. They were gentle because, as they explained, the red blood cells were alive. If the blood was mishandled&#x2014; shaken or heated, or left in a refrigerator beyond four weeks or so&#x2014;the cells would die.<br> <br>Filling the bags took about fifteen or twenty minutes. The bags plumped up until the scale showed we were done: one pint, 500 milliliters. Then, unhook: needle out. Cotton ball, pressure. Bags taped closed, labeled, and tucked into the blue cooler.

Chloe hopes a consulting job at Green Bay's Heritage Hill Historical Park, where an old Belgian-American farmhouse is being restored, will be a relaxing escape.&nbsp;<br><br>Instead she discovers a body in a century-old bake oven.<br><br>Chloe's research suggests that a rare and valuable piece of lace made its way to nearby Door County, Wisconsin, with the earliest Belgian settlers. More importantly, someone is desperate to find it. Inspired by a courageous Belgian woman who survived cholera, famine, and the Great Fire, Chloe must untangle clues to reveal secrets old and new . . . before the killer strikes again.</p><p>One of the pleasures of writing a series is the opportunity to delve more deeply into the main characters with each new book. Chloe and Roelke's struggles often mirror issues that the historical characters face. Themes in this book--reflected in both the modern and historical timelines--include challenges of faith and forgiveness.<br><br>Faith helped Belgian immigrants face the enormous obstacles they encountered, beginning in the 1850s, establishing new lives as farmers in the thickly forested wilderness of northeast Wisconsin. Their faith, and incredible hard work, created the largest rural settlement of Belgians in our country.&nbsp;<br><br>As Chloe researches their history, she becomes dangerously tangled in a pattern&nbsp;of modern murders tied to their Belgian American descendants, and lace.<p><strong>Kathleen Ernst</strong> is an award-winning and bestselling author, educator, and social historian.

Bruce Knecht tells the staggering story of the 54th Sydney to Hobart yacht race--an annual event that is always an extreme test of courage and skill in some of the world's most treacherous seas, but which in 1998 would become the most disastrous race in modern yachting history.<p> </p><blockquote>Although he was already fifty feet from the boat, Brownie didn't have any trouble spotting Glyn. He looked small, and utterly helpless.... Glyn was already having a hard time keeping his head out of the water, and everyone quickly reached the same unthinkable conclusion--Glynn was going to die and there was nothing to do but watch.... Steve Kulmar was more shaken than anyone. When he first came on deck, he believed Glyn was looking directly back at him.</blockquote><p> Of the 115 boats that started under clear skies in Sydney, just 43 would finish. Six sailors lost their lives, and a further 55 were plucked from the storm after the fleet had been decimated by unforecast hurricane winds and 80-foot-high waves.</p><p> Knecht's style is novelistic, though measured, with a strong journalistic sensibility marshaling what must have been at times appallingly poignant eyewitness testimony into a coherent account of the disaster. His intended focus is beyond the headlines, and by concentrating on the experiences of a handful of individual crews, <i>The Proving Ground</i> succeeds in conveying the agonies of their desperate, sometimes futile struggles to survive--and offers some insight into what drew them to the sea in the first place, and why so many of the survivors have felt compelled to face it again. --<i>Alex Hankin, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>After earning his MBA at Harvard, Bruce Knecht began writing for The Wall Street Journal in New York, where he covered the banking and publishing industries before he became a Hong Kong-based foreign correspondent. He is an avid sailor who has written for Conde Nast Traveler, The Atlantic Monthly, and the Journal.</p><h2>Hiznobyuti</h2><p><b>From one of France's most celebrated children's writers, the story of an "ugly duckling" who leaves his family to journey through a fantastical world.

His bursting creativity and the wealth of his images incite the almost systematic pleasure of children. The Pontian universe, with its many cultural and artistic references, its themes and its language distinctive of the world of childhood, its originality in its forms, colors, typography, and the arrangement of its scenes, presents an offering of narratives that strongly engage children's emotions and which meet them on the horizon of their expectations.

It was insane to believe one person could split time, energy, and emotion between law, with all its rights and wrongs, and family, with all its demands and personalities.</p><p>Both careers&#x2014;and from what she&#x2019;d observed, marriage was a job&#x2014;had impossible demands and hellish hours. It might have been 2058, an enlightened time of technological advancement, but marriage was still marriage. To Eve it translated to terror.</p><p>Yet here she was on a fine day in high summer&#x2014;one of her rare and precious days off&#x2014;preparing to go shopping. She couldn&#x2019;t stop the shudder.</p><p>Not just shopping, she reminded herself as her stomach clutched, shopping for a wedding dress.</p><p>Obviously she&#x2019;d lost her mind.</p><p>It was Roarke&#x2019;s doing, of course. He&#x2019;d caught her at a weak moment. Both of them bleeding and bruised and lucky to be alive. When a man is clever enough and knows his quarry well enough to choose such a time and place to propose marriage, well, a woman was a goner.</p><p>At least a woman like Eve Dallas.</p><p>&#x201c;You look like you&#x2019;re about to take on a gang of chemi-thugs bare-handed.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve tugged on a shoe, flicked her gaze up and over. He was entirely too attractive, she thought. Criminally so. The strong face, poet&#x2019;s mouth, killer blue eyes. The wizard&#x2019;s mane of thick black hair. If you managed to get past the face to the body, it was equally impressive. Then you added that faint wisp of Ireland in the voice, and, well, you had one hell of a package.</p><p>&#x201c;What I&#x2019;m about to take on is worse than any chemi-head.&#x201d; Hearing the whine in her own voice, Eve scowled. She never whined. But the truth was, she&#x2019;d have preferred fighting hand to hand with a souped-up addict than discussing hemlines.</p><p>Hemlines, for sweet Christ&#x2019;s sake.</p><p>She bit back an oath, watching him narrowly as he crossed the spacious bedroom. He had a way of making her feel foolish at odd times. Like now as he sat beside her on the high, wide bed they shared.</p><p>He caught her chin in his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hopelessly in love with you.&#x201d;</p><p>There he was. This man with the sinfully blue eyes, the strong, gorgeous, somehow Raphaelite looks of a doomed angel, loved her.</p><p>&#x201c;Roarke.&#x201d; She struggled to hold back a sigh. She could and had faced an armed laser in the hands of a mad mutant mercenary with less fear than she faced such unswerving emotion. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going through with it. I said I would.&#x201d;</p><p>His brow quirked, dark and wry. He wondered how she remained so unaware of her own appeal as she sat there, fretting, her poorly cut fawn-colored hair standing up in tufts and spikes, aroused by her restless hands, thin lines of annoyance and doubt running between her big, whiskey-colored eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Darling Eve.&#x201d; He kissed her, lightly, once on the frowning lips, then again in the gentle dip in her chin. &#x201c;I never doubted it.&#x201d; Though he had, constantly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve several things I have to see to today. You were late last night. I never had a chance to ask if you had plans.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The stakeout on the Bines case went to after oh three hundred.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did you get him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Walked right into my arms&#x2014;blissed on dreamers and a marathon VR session.&#x201d; She smiled, but it was the hunter&#x2019;s smile, dark and feral. &#x201c;Murdering little bastard came along like my personal droid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, then.&#x201d; He patted her shoulder before rising. He stepped down from the platform into the dressing area where he pondered a selection of jackets. &#x201c;And today? Reports to file?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m off today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh?&#x201d; Distracted, he turned back, a gorgeous silk jacket in deep charcoal in his hand. &#x201c;I can reschedule some of my afternoon, if you like.&#x201d;</p><p>Which would be, Eve mused, a bit like a general rescheduling battles. In Roarke&#x2019;s world, business was a complicated and profitable war. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m already booked.&#x201d; The scowl snuck back on her before she could stop it. &#x201c;Shopping,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;Wedding dress.&#x201d;</p><p>Now he smiled, quickly, easily. From her, such plans were a declaration of love. &#x201c;No wonder you&#x2019;re so cranky. I told you I&#x2019;d see to it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pick out my own wedding dress. And I&#x2019;ll buy it myself. I&#x2019;m not marrying you for your damn money.&#x201d;</p><p>Smooth and elegant as the jacket he slipped on, he continued to smile. &#x201c;Why are you marrying me, Lieutenant?&#x201d; Her scowl deepened, but he was, above all, a patient man. &#x201c;Want a multiple choice?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because you never take no for an answer.&#x201d; She stood, shoving her hands into the front pockets of her jeans.</p><p>&#x201c;You only get a half point for that. Try again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because I&#x2019;ve lost my mind.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That won&#x2019;t win you the trip for two to Tropic World on Star 50.&#x201d;</p><p>A reluctant smile tugged at her lips. &#x201c;Maybe I love you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe you do.&#x201d; Content with that, he crossed back to her and laid his hands on her strong shoulders. &#x201c;How bad can it be? You can pop a few shopping programs into the computer, look at dozens of suitable dresses, order in what appeals to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That was my idea.&#x201d; She rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Mavis ditched it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mavis.&#x201d; He paled a bit. &#x201c;Eve, tell me you&#x2019;re not going shopping with Mavis.&#x201d;</p><p>His reaction brightened her mood a little. &#x201c;She has this friend. He&#x2019;s a designer.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dear Christ.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She says he&#x2019;s mag. Just needs a break to make a name for himself. He has a little workshop in Soho.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s elope. Now. You look fine.&#x201d;</p><p>Her grin flashed. &#x201c;Scared?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Terrified.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. Now we&#x2019;re even.&#x201d; Delighted to be on level footing, she leaned in and kissed him. &#x201c;Now you can worry about what I&#x2019;ll be wearing on the big day for the next few weeks. Gotta go.&#x201d; She patted his cheek. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m meeting her in twenty minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Eve.&#x201d; Roarke grabbed for her hand. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t do something ridiculous?&#x201d;</p><p>She tugged her way free. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting married, aren&#x2019;t I? What could be more ridiculous?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>She hoped he stewed over it all day. The idea of marriage was daunting enough, but a wedding&#x2014;clothes, flowers, music, people. It was horrifying.</p><p>She zipped downtown on Lex, braking hard and muttering curses at a sidewalk vendor who encroached on the lane with his smoking glide cart. The traffic violation was bad enough, but the scent of overcooked soydogs hit her nervous stomach like lead.</p><p>The Rapid cab behind her broke the intercity noise pollution code by blasting his horn and shouting curses through his speaker. A group, obviously tourists, loaded down with palm cams, compumaps, and binoks gaped stupidly at the whizzing traffic. Eve shook her head as a quick-fingered street thief elbowed through them.</p><p>When they got back to their hotel, they were going to find themselves several credits poorer. If she&#x2019;d had the time and a place to pull over, she might have given the thief a chase. But he was lost in the crowd and a block across town on his air skates before she could blink.</p><p>That was New York, she thought with a faint smile. Take it at your own risk.</p><p>She loved the crowds, the noise, the constant frantic rush of it. You were rarely alone, but never intimate. That&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;d come here so many years ago.</p><p>No, she wasn&#x2019;t a social animal, but too much space and too much solitude made her nervous.</p><p>She&#x2019;d come to New York to be a cop, because she believed in order, needed it to survive. Her miserable and abusive childhood with all its blank spaces and dark corners couldn&#x2019;t be changed. But she had changed. She had taken control, had made herself into the person some anonymous social worker had named Eve Dallas.</p><p>Now she was changing again. In a few weeks she wouldn&#x2019;t just be Eve Dallas, lieutenant, homicide. She&#x2019;d be Roarke&#x2019;s wife. How she would manage to be both was more of a mystery to her than any case that had ever come across her desk.</p><p>Neither of them knew what it was to be family, to have family, to make a family. They knew cruelty, abuse, abandonment. She wondered if that was why they had come together. They both understood what it was to have nothing, to be nothing, to know fear and hunger and despair&#x2014;and both had remade themselves.</p><p>Was it just mutual need that attracted them? Need for sex, for love, and the melding of the two that she had never thought was possible before Roarke.</p><p><i>A question for Dr. Mira,</i> she mused, thinking of the police psychiatrist she often consulted.</p><p>But for now, Eve determined that she wasn&#x2019;t going to think about the future or the past. The moment was complicated enough.</p><p>Three blocks from Greene Street, she seized her chance and squeezed into a parking space. After searching through her pockets, she found the credit tokens the aging meter demanded in its moronic and static jumbled tones and plugged in enough for two hours.</p><p>If it took any more than that, she&#x2019;d be ready for a tranq room and a parking citation wouldn&#x2019;t bother her in the least.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, sh...</p></p><h2>Into The Heart Of Borneo</h2><p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;ve left a lot of men in Borneo &#x2013; know what I mean?&#x2019; With their SAS trainer&#x2019;s warnings ringing in their ears, the naturalist, Redmond O&#x2019;Hanlon, and the poet, James Fenton, set out to rediscover the lost rhinoceros of Borneo. They were loaded with enough back-breaking kit to survive two months in a steaming 95� (in the shade) jungle of creeping, crawling, biting things. O&#x2019;Hanlon could also rely on his encyclopaedic knowledge of the region&#x2019;s flora and fauna, and had read-up on how to avoid being eaten by anything (stick your thumbs in a crocodile&#x2019;s eyes, if you have time). And yet they proceeded to have an adventure that neither O&#x2019;Hanlon, nor his friend, nor even his guides were remotely prepared for... &#x2018;Consistently exciting, often funny, and erudite without ever being overwhelming&#x2019; Punch.</p><p>"Ye Gods, old man--don't do it!" you're bound to shriek on page 1 of this hilarious travelogue, on which the author lists the hazards that may befall him--vipers, cholera, crocs, ticks, tuberculosis, malaria, rabies, and 1,700 types of parasitic worms among them. After all, portly, over-the-hill <i>London Times</i> literary reviewer Redmond O'Hanlon hasn't done anything more aerobic than flip the pages of a book for decades; he wasn't even a Boy Scout. It's hardly reassuring that his colleague, poet James Fenton--who had the big idea to trek in Borneo--was a Boy Scout. He hated it, and besides, aged, balding Fenton, whom O'Hanlon describes as rather worm-like, sounds like he's a likely lunch for a swooping black eagle.<p> But on they trod--with the much-needed help of three Iban natives and an unseen, though oft-quoted river god--through jungle, across rivers whose height may rise seven feet overnight, and via native villages (where they often have late-night parties), with one goal in mind: seeing the fabled Borneo rhino. Fenton is nearly swept away in a whirlpool, they subsist on jungle-worm gruel, and ripping off sucking leeches is a near-daily occurrence, but cultural and natural insights and adventures abound in this rip-roaringly funny and deftly written travelogue that will have you chortling out loud. <i>--Melissa Rossi</i></p>The story of a 1983 journey to the center of Borneo, which no expedition had attempted since 1926.

Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things one can best discover for oneself), <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> makes another good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist.<br> &nbsp;<br> After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>Mirror Dance</i>, and both, ideally, before <i>Memory.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Komarr</i> makes another good alternate entry point for the series, picking up Miles's second career at its start.&nbsp; It should be read before <i>A Civil Campaign</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of the five currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure sampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit themselves to length.&nbsp; (But it may make more sense if read after <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>.)&nbsp; Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with the main body of the series.&nbsp; Most readers recommend picking up this story later. It should likely be read before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however, which revisits the "quaddies", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear in italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words and 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i><br> <i>Shards of Honor</i><br> <i>Barrayar</i><br> <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i><br> "The Mountains of Mourning"<br> "Weatherman"<br> <i>The Vor Game</i><br> <i>Cetaganda</i><br> <i>Ethan of Athos</i><br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i><br> "Labyrinth"<br> "The Borders of Infinity" <br> <i>Brothers in Arms</i><br> <i>Mirror Dance</i><br> <i>Memory</i><br> <i>Komarr</i><br> <i>A Civil Campaign</i><br> "Winterfair Gifts"<br> <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i><br> <i>Captain Vorpatril's </i><i>Alliance</i><i>&nbsp; </i>(upcoming in late 2012)<br> <i>CryoBurn</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Caveats:<br> &nbsp;<br> The novella "Weatherman" is an out-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The Vor Game</i>.&nbsp; If you already have <i>The Vor Game</i>, you likely don't need this.<br> &nbsp;<br> The original 'novel' <i>Borders of Infinity</i> was a fix-up collection containing the three novellas "The Mountains of Mourning", "Labyrinth", and "The Borders of Infinity", together with a frame story to tie the pieces together. Again, beware duplication.&nbsp; The frame story does not stand alone, and generally is of interest only to completists.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Fantasy Novels</b><br> &nbsp;<br> My fantasy novels are a bit easier to order.&nbsp; Easiest of all is <i>The Spirit Ring</i>, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed books that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series.&nbsp; Next easiest are the four volumes of <i>The Sharing Knife</i>--in order, <i>Beguilement</i>, <i>Legacy</i>, <i>Passage</i>, and <i>Horizon</i>--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks.<br> &nbsp;<br> What have come to be called the Chalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written, like the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and can in theory be read in any order.&nbsp; (The third book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely connected first two.)&nbsp; Some readers think the world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in publication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the first (but not the third.)&nbsp; In any case, the publication order is:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Curse of Chalion</i><br> <i>Paladin of Souls</i><br> <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Happy reading!<br> &nbsp;<br> -- Lois McMaster Bujold.</p><h2>Goodnight Harry</h2><p>&#34;Goodnight, everyone,&#34; says Harry. &#34;Zzz,&#34; goes Lulu. &#34;Snore,&#34; goes Ted.

Ms. Woolley lived in Truro, Massachusetts, until her death in 2005.</p>PreSchool-Grade 1 What a pleasure it is to welcome a new edition of Jane Thayer's charming book, first illustrated by Seymour Fleishman (Morrow, 1958). More than anything in the world, Petey, a puppy, wanted a boy for Christmas. Nothing else his mother suggested would do, and none of the other dogs would give him their boys. Dejected, Petey passes the Home for Boys where a lonely newcomer sits on the steps. Petey has found not one boy, but 50 boys full of love. McCue's puppy is a frisky, impish dog-pound special, closely resembling her Sebastian, the Super Sleuth of Mary Blount Christian's novels (Macmillan). However, where Sebastian is portrayed with scratchboard, Petey and friends are in naturalistic watercolors highlighted with crayon. The "Orphan's Home" of the earlier edition has become a Home for Boys; minor changes in the text are in keeping with evolving life styles; the interracial boys are in cords, blue jeans and sneakers. With updated text and illustrations, an old friend has a new personality, and Petey is virtually guaranteed another almost 40 years of popularity with the picture book crowd.Virginia Opocensky, Lincoln City Libraries, Nebr.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Shimmer of Hummingbirds: A Birder Murder Mystery</h2><p><b>Sometimes, the wrong choice is the only choice you have.</b><br><br> Chief Inspector Domenic Jejeune is hoping an overseas birding trip might hold some answers in his fugitive brother&#x2018;s manslaughter case.

Along the lane, the grassy verges bowed with their burdens of frost, and lacy collars of ice fringed the edges of the puddles. On the far side of the lane, beyond the hedgerow, the skeleton shapes of bare trees lined the boundaries of the fields. Stands of pale grass moved uneasily beneath metallic skies. Winter was stretching its fingers over the landscape, and if it had not yet drawn them in, to clasp the land fully in its grip, the time was surely near. <br> The street lamps along the lane were already on, shining through the grey light of the fading afternoon like tiny suns. Suspended in their light, ice crystals spiralled like shards of shattered glass. From the window of a small cottage, a man watched a girl&#x2019;s progress along the lane. The lace curtain hung from his fingertip like a veil. &#x201c;Prospect, Erin,&#x201d; he said without turning. The man&#x2019;s shoulders were hunched slightly, as if he might be expecting a strike from the tension that seemed to hang in the room like a presence. &#x201c;This could be the one.&#x201d; <br> From the armchair behind the man, Erin offered no opinion. A kitten mewled around the legs of the chair, looking for an affectionate pat that wasn&#x2019;t forthcoming. At the window, the man&#x2019;s eyes tracked the girl&#x2019;s approach carefully. She was perhaps eighteen, a youngish eighteen, though, slightly-built, with hardly an ounce of adult bulk on her delicate frame. He wondered if she was a runner. But there was no sign of well-developed muscle tone, no athletic spring in her step. Besides, it hardly mattered. Those boots she was wearing, all pointy toes and high heels, would not be much good for running over the uneven cobblestone surface of this laneway. Not that he intended to give her the chance. <br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said the man, nodding softly to himself, his eyes flickering slightly as he watched her. He could feel the pressure building in his chest. The hair at his collar was damp with sweat and the dryness in his mouth made it hard to swallow. Stage fright. He closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. He was surprised to find it affecting him like this. He had been over the scenario many times in his head. He should be calmer than this. But the heart holds surprises for even the most disciplined minds, and now the moment of truth was drawing close, the doubts were starting to flood in. <br> The girl was closer now, and he could see the wispy trail of her breath as she chatted on her phone. Distracted. Not ideal. He wanted her to know what was happening, to take it all in, to be aware of everything. His eyes moved to the greying sky beyond her, and then switched anxiously back and forth along the lane. No one. He turned his attention back to the girl, perhaps twenty metres away now, no more. If it was going to be this one, he had only a few seconds. Cap, jacket, open the door and run. Her head would spin around at the sound of his approach, just in time to see him bearing down on her. A momentary look of confusion on her face? Panic? Terror? And then. Over. It would be done. He could feel his pulse throbbing in his temples. This has to be done. His heart was racing. You have to do it. He clenched his fingers into his palm, feeling their wetness. But still he hesitated. <br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Erin. This one? Or not?&#x201d; <br> <i>Not.</i> <br> He let out a pent up breath and withdrew his finger, letting the curtains fall back into place with a delicate shimmer. From behind his lace screen, he watched the girl pass beneath the street lamp outside, still chatting on her phone. Her breath spiralled up in the cold air, seeming to him like whispered prayers, drifting up to heaven. She would never know how close she had come. <br> It was the light. It was important, perhaps the most important thing of all. It needed to be right, and it wasn&#x2019;t. Not yet. The man saw the mug on the window ledge in front of him and a bolt of alarm speared his chest. What if he had left it here, in his rush to get outside? He picked up the mug and carried it wordlessly into the kitchen. As he walked past the armchair, the kitten let out a small bleat. It looked for a moment as if it might follow the man into the kitchen, but in the end it jumped up onto Erin&#x2019;s lap and curled itself inside its tiny tail to go to sleep. <br> In the kitchen, the man set the empty, unwashed cup carefully in the sink. He peered out the kitchen window, checking the narrow garden as it ran down to the boat dock. He could feel the cold winter air coming in through the neat hole in the glass panel of the door. On the far bank of the river that ran behind the cottages, a pair of Mallards was hunkered down, blending in to the pale, brittle reed stems. Nothing else moved. <br> The man sat for a long time at the kitchen table, watching as the day retreated into the half-light of dusk. There was a large part of him that didn&#x2019;t want to do this. But something else had taken over. His actions were no longer his to control. His breathing had begun to quicken again. He steadied it. He felt tiny droplets of moisture running down his temples. Sweat. DNA. Bad thing. <br> He stood up quickly and walked back into the tiny, neat living room, now sheltering pockets of darkness in its corners. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll leave the lights off for now, Erin,&#x201d; he announced. He approached the bay window and peered through the curtains again. All the other cottages had lights on now. From outside, this one would look like a missing stone in the necklace of lighted windows that ran along the lane. <br> The man checked his reflection in the window glass; the brown leather jacket with its soft corduroy collar; the cap, tilted far enough forward to hide the plastic lining. And the greying goatee, with the little horns on the moustache. He gave the beard a downward stroke with his thumb and forefinger, as if to ensure it was in place. From the corner of his eye, he caught a flicker of movement, and he turned quickly to see a woman walking slowly down the lane, carefully picking her way between the puddles. Not up from the village as he had always envisioned it, but coming from the other direction. Panic started to rise within him. This was wrong. Why hadn&#x2019;t he ever considered this? Pull yourself together. What did it matter? She was taller than the other one and slightly older; a year or two. More woman than girl, this one. His mouth felt dry, and he dragged the back of his wrist across his lips. His breathing was shallow and rapid. A whisper of doubt flickered across his mind. Would she put up a fight? Try to grab him? No, he thought, the twilight, the shock; they would do their work. It would all happen the way he had planned it. <br> The woman was getting closer. Another fifty metres and she would be directly beneath the street lamp outside. Darkness all around and just that tiny pool of yellow light spilling onto the cobblestone lane like a spotlight on a stage. He watched her approaching. She had picked up her pace slightly and was hunched against the evening, as if something in her subconscious might be whispering about the dangers a quiet lane like this could hold. He wondered where she was going. Home after a hard day&#x2019;s work? To the pub to meet her friends? Or her boyfriend? It didn&#x2019;t matter. <br> Seated at the window, his right knee was bobbing up and down like a piston, resisting all his efforts to control it. His heart felt like it might explode from his chest. He was finding it hard to breathe. The mantra built in his mind, like the roar of an oncoming train. <i>This has to be done. You have to do it.</i> &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s where I have to leave you, Erin,&#x201d; said the man over his shoulder, not taking his eyes off the woman outside. His mouth was dry again and he licked his lips to moisten them. As the woman approached the pool of light beneath the street lamp, the man stood up. He ran to the front door and snatched it open. The door banged back against the wall of the cottage, but the woman was already looking in his direction &#x2014; that primeval mechanism, perhaps, alerting her to danger? It was already too late. The man sprinted toward her. She stared, frozen in terror, as he closed the gap. Less than five metres now, with no signs of slowing. The woman raised her hands defensively, bracing for the impact. The man exploded into her, lowering his head and smashing his cap into her face. The impact lifted the woman off her feet and sent her flailing back against the street lamp, snapping her head back hard against the post. Lying on the cold round. Stunned. She heard rapid footfalls; the sound of running. She raised her head and managed to focus in time to see the man sprinting away down the centre of the narrow lane. His escape rang off the cobblestones until, like the assailant himself, the sound finally disappeared into the night. From behind the screen of the net curtains, the sightlines from Erin&#x2019;s armchair to the street lamp were unobstructed. The woman was still on the ground, sobbing softly now, reeling from her injuries. She was beginning to shiver, too, as shock began to seep into the places where her fear had been. But Erin didn&#x2019;t go to her, or call out to check if she needed help. Nor did Erin reach for a telephone to call for an ambulance, or a police officer. Erin Dawes did not respond at all. The dead never do.</p><h2>Health Tonics, Elixirs and Potions for the Look and Feel of Youth</h2><p>In this book, Carlson Wade, a leading health researcher, reports on a startling new Youth Restoration Program that uses ordinary household ingredients - available for pennies, without prescription...health tonics, elixirs and potions that may actually strike back at serious diseases, bring relief from seemingly hopeless aches and pains, and begin generating new health and energy to every area of the body!

Floored by sedation-addiction (booze and pills) and depression in middle age. Blind-sided by cancer in his most recent years. Were you looking for a spokesperson for the Justi�ed Self-pity Foundation you would have to look no further than Wilfrid Sheed. But for this eminent novelist and essayist it has been the &#x201c;primal insight&#x201d; of his bouts with a brace of illnesses, each of which have caused him &#x201c;to lose something I would have sworn I couldn&#x2019;t live without,&#x201d; that just being alive, &#x201c;even on a no-frills basis, is astoundingly good.&#x201d; And in the giddy rush of that realization there&#x2019;s just no room for feeling sorry for oneself. Written in an inimitably rough-housing prose, Sheed&#x2019;s uplifting memoir dramatically details the &#x201c;bad night&#x201d; that illness is, then puts its whole soul into celebrating waking from the night to fall &#x201c;head over heels in love with daylight.&#x201d;Novelist Reynolds Price (A Whole New Life, LJ 3/1/94) battled spinal cancer; essayist Lucy Grealy (Autobiography of a Face, LJ 7/94) struggled to restore her disfigured face; writer Gretel Ehrlich (A Match to the Heart, Pantheon, 1994) survived being struck by lightning; author Paul West (A Stroke of Genius, LJ 11/1/94) endured a string of illnesses. Critic Sheed (Essays in Disguise, LJ 3/1/90) joins his literary colleagues with this memoir of his recovery from childhood polio, depression caused by pill and alcohol addiction, and cancer. However, his rambling, tortuous musings lack the emotional power of the other works, and the reader often wishes Sheed would get to the point. Saying very little about his bouts with polio and cancer, Sheed focuses mostly on his effort to overcome his addictions; he has no kind words for psychiatrists, 12-step programs, and "Happy Valley" sanatoriums. Still, his saving grace is humor and optimism in the face of disaster.

Here, set against the backdrop of America struggling through the Depression, is the world of magic, a realm of stars, sleight of hand, and sin where dreams could be realized-or stolen away. <br><br>Following the Crash of '29, Dai Vernon, known by magicians as "the man who fooled Houdini," is tramping down Midwestern backroads, barely making ends meet. While swapping secrets with a Mexican gambler, he hears of a guy he doesn't quite believe is real-a legendary mystery man who deals perfectly from the center of the deck and who locals call the greatest cardsharp of all time. Determined to find the reclusive genius, Vernon sets out on a journey through America's shady, slick, and sinful side-from mob-run Kansas City through railroad towns that looked sleepy only in the daytime. Does he find the sharp? <br><br>Well, Karl Johnson did-after years of research into Vernon's colorful quest, research that led him to places he never knew existed. Johnson takes us to the cardsharp's doorstep and shows us how he bestowed on Vernon the greatest secret in magic. <i>The Magician and the Cardsharp</i> is a unique and endlessly entertaining piece of history that reveals the artistry and obsession of a special breed of American showmen.<br></p><p>Karl Johnson, a former editor at the <i>New York Daily News</i>, has written for many major newspapers and periodicals. <i>The Magician and the Cardsharp</i> grew out of an article published in <i>American Heritage </i>magazine. He lives in New York City.<br>This engrossing detective story traces the quest of Dai Vernon, n� David Verner (1894&#x2013;1992), to find the man who perfected the art of dealing from the center of the deck. An accomplished card cheat, sleight-of-hand magician and silhouette portraitist, Vernon was so expert at duplicitous card techniques that he once fooled Houdini with tricks he'd learned as a child from S.W. Erdnase's classic <i>The Expert at the Card Table</i>. Proficient at dealing from the top and bottom of the deck, he was astounded to learn that someone in the Midwest had the ability to win by dealing from the center. Johnson, a former editor at New York's <i>Daily News,</i> details Vernon's long search for Allen Kennedy (1865&#x2013;1961), a cardsharp who plied his trade with loaded dice and deceitful deck handling. By recounting the shadowy careers of these two men, the author successfully evokes the picturesque world of illegal gambling during the 1920s, '30s and '40s. Johnson vividly conveys how obsessed Vernon was with magic and card tricks, and how much time, energy and practice gamblers put into learning how to cheat at cards. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Wilding takes a job as secretary to the painter, but finds his task complicated by his growing attraction to his employer's daughter and by his own secret yearning to paint.

She lives in New York City and in Maine. Victor Bockris IS THE AUTHOR OF UPTIGHT: THE STORY OF THE VELVET UNDERGROUND, and TK other books on music and culture. He lives in New York City.High-spirited teenager Bebe Buell didn't want to stay home in Virginia in the early 1970s; she knew she was destined for a faster paced life. After graduating from high school, she ran away to Virginia Beach to escape her father's strict military discipline. She returned home, but, with her mother's support, soon moved to New York and became a moderately successful Eileen Ford model. However, even more appealing to Bebe was the world of rock music. She became a groupie of sorts hanging out with Todd Rundgren, Andy Warhol and Iggy Pop. (She's said to have provided some of the inspiration for Kate Hudson's character in Almost Famous.) In addition to Bebe's sexual exploits with celebrities (the list is long; highlights include David Bowie, Elvis Costello, Rod Stewart), she served as a muse and actual wordsmith, recording with the Cars in 1980: "I was never on a quest for sex itself. In fact, to me, it's the hardest part of a relationship. I was always on a quest for rock 'n' roll." From the 1970s to the 1990s, she drifted from man to man and drugs of various sorts, with the one stable force being her daughter, Liv Tyler, by Aerosmith's Steven Tyler. While some aging boomers may relish another account of the good old, bad old days of rock and roll, this memoir is disappointing. Bebe's raucous life amid glam rockers and glitterati sure sounds fun, but her story adds little to what has already been documented about these times. Photos not seen by PW.

Ever since I'd been released from prison, I'd often felt that if I directed this knowledge into the right channels, I could help people a great deal. Every time I went to the store and wrote a check, I would see two or three mistakes made on the part of the clerk or cashier, mistakes that a flimflam artist would take advantage of. . . . In a certain sense, I'm still a con artist. I'm just putting down a positive con these days, as opposed to the negative con I used in the past. I've merely redirected the talents I've always possessed. I've applied the same relentless attention to working on stopping fraud that I once applied to perpetuating fraud."<br><br>In<b> Catch Me if You Can</b><i>,</i> Frank W. Abagnale recounted his youthful career as a master imposter and forger. In <b>The Art of the Steal</b>, Abagnale tells the remarkable story of how he parlayed his knowledge of cons and scams into a successful career as a consultant on preventing financial foul play--while showing you how to identify and outsmart perpetrators of fraud.<br><br>Technology may have made it easier to track down criminals, but cyberspace has spawned a skyrocketing number of ways to commit crime--much of it untraceable. Businesses are estimated to lose an unprecedented $400 billion a year from fraud of one sort or another. If we were able to do away with fraud for just two years, we'd erase the national debt and pay Social Security for the next one hundred years. However, Abagnale has discovered that punishment for committing fraud, much less recovery of stolen funds, seldom happens: Once you're a victim, you won't get your money back. Prevention is the best form of protection. <br><br>Drawn from his twenty-five years of experience as an ingenious con artist (whose check scams alone mounted to more than $2 million in stolen funds), Abagnale's <b>The Art of the Steal</b><i> </i>provides eye-opening stories of true scams, with tips on how they can be prevented. Abagnale takes you deep inside the world and mind of the con artist, showing you just how he pulled off his scams and what you can do to avoid becoming the next victim. You'll hear the stories of notorious swindles, like the mustard squirter trick and the "rock in the box" ploy, and meet the criminals like the famous Vickers Gang who perpetrated them. You'll find out why crooks wash checks and iron credit cards and why a thief brings glue with him to the ATM. And finally, you'll learn how to recognize a bogus check or a counterfeit bill, and why you shouldn't write your grocery list on a deposit slip.<br>A revealing look inside the predatory criminal mind from a former master of the con, <b>The Art of the Steal</b> is the ultimate defense against even the craftiest crook.</p><p>Author Frank W. Abagnale knows something about fraud--he once committed it for a living. "Through my various hustles, I passed something like $2.5 million worth of checks, a blizzard of paper that I scattered in earnest throughout all fifty states and twenty-six countries, all before I was legally allowed to drink," he writes. "I was proficient enough at cashing fraudulent checks that I earned the distinction of becoming one of the most hunted criminals by the FBI." Abagnale was ultimately caught, and he served prison sentences in France, Sweden, and the United States. In the 25 years since his release, Abagnale (who also wrote <i>Catch Me If You Can</i>) has become a leading consultant on fraud prevention. <p> "I'm still a con artist. I'm just putting down a positive con these days, as opposed to the negative con I used in the past," he explains. "I've applied the same relentless attention to working on stopping fraud that I once applied to perpetrating fraud." His expertise comes in handy: businesses lose an estimated $400 billion each year to fraud. The stories Abagnale tells in <i>The Art of the Steal</i> provide fascinating glimpses of a criminal underworld. He describes "shoulder surfers" who rip off bank customers at ATMs by videotaping their fingers as they enter PIN numbers, retrieving receipts from wastebaskets, and then creating fake credit cards--all rather inexpensively. Whole sections of the book almost read like a how-to manual for aspiring thieves, though Abagnale has other motives. Throughout, he offers sensible advice on how to foil the con artists. Much of this is common sense (cut up credit cards when they expire), but some of his suggestions aren't so obvious. He warns readers not to write checks to the "IRS," for instance: "Envelopes to the IRS are common targets because of where they're going." Instead, checks should be made out to the "Internal Revenue Service," because criminals can turn the "I" of "IRS" into an "M," and turn a tax payment into a gift for "MRS." Smith. The chapter on the emerging problem of identity theft--with its tips on how to keep Social Security numbers private--is especially helpful. In all, <i>The Art of the Steal</i> is captivating and useful. <i>--John Miller</i></p>A former professional impostor and the author of the bestselling memoir, <b>Catch Me If You Can</b>, Frank W. Abagnale is one of the world&#x2019;s most respected authorities on the subjects of forgery and secure documents.

For her twelfth birthday, Hills Aunt Pansy had one of her stories published in a book of short stories. This was the beginning of Hills career as a writer. In 1886, Hill and her family moved to Winter Park, Florida, where she got a job teaching gymnastics at a local college. She wrote her first real book there, in an effort to raise money for a family vacation to Chautauqua Lake. The book was called Chatauqua Idyl and was published in 1887 by D. Lothrop and Company, the same publisher that printed her first story when she was twelve. Hill was eventually married and began a family, but lost her husband to appendicitis. At this point in her life, her writing was the only means she had to keep food on the table and money in her pockets. In her lifetime, Hill wrote over a hundred books, only two of which were non-fiction. Grace Livingston Hill died in 1947 at the age of 82.</p><h2>The Honoured Society: The Sicilian Mafia Observed</h2><p>Norman Lewis is felt by many to be England&#39;s finest living travel writer. He has written a dozen travel books and many novels. Here he brilliantly dissects the Mafia, past and present, combining history, sociology, suspense, horror, and superb travel writing. Originally published in 1964, Lewis describes how, after Mussolini came close to destroying the Mafia, the U.S. Army returned them to power in 1944. Henceforth, they infiltrated every aspect of Sicilian life, corrupting landowners, the police, the judiciary, and even the church. In one of the most astonishing chapters, Lewis tells the story of how an eighty-year old priest led his monks on escapades of murder and extortion, frequently using the confessional box for transmitting threats. Lewis exposes its origins, its code of honor, its secrecy, and its brutality. The Honoured Society is the perfect companion for any traveler to Sicily, and a gripping armchair read.</p><p>Norman Lewis is England&#39;s finest, living travel writer. He has written a dozen travel books, including such masterpieces as Naples&#39;44, Golden Earth and A Dragon Apparent. He has also written thirteen novels. Lewis regards his life&#39;s major achievement to be the reaction to an article written by him entitled Genocide in Brazil, published in 1968. This led to a change in Brazilian law relating to the treatment of Indians, and to the formation of Survival International, which campaigns for the rights of indigenous peoples.&#34;It&#39;s pre-Godfather, but still the best book ever written on the Mafia, soaked in terribilita and reported by a master.&#34;</p><h2>Life, the Universe and Everything</h2><p>Thirty years of celebrating the comic genius of Douglas Adams...

His works have been translated into more than forty languages and have been best sellers throughout the world. He lives in Scotland.<i>Chapter 1</i><br><br>&#x201c;Adlestrop,&#x201d; said Isabel Dalhousie.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie thought for a moment. They were sitting in their kitchen, on one of those indecisive days that was summer, but not quite yet; a day when the heating might as well be off as on, but when prudence&#x2014;and superstition&#x2014;required it still to be kept going. If you lived in Scotland and you turned off your heating too early, then the weather gods&#x2014;stern, Nordic and unforgiving&#x2014;could send a body of cold air down from the Arc�tic and remind you that they, not you, were in control.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie at least had taken off his sweater&#x2014;as an act of faith, thought Isabel&#x2014;while she had kept hers on. One of the news�papers, glimpsed in the local newsagent&#x2019;s shop, had featured the headline <i>Weathermen say summer will be scorching! </i>but Isabel remembered that this particular newspaper said much the same thing every year, out of concern for its readers, she decided, who otherwise were deprived of good news, and who were desperate for any meteorological crumb of comfort.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, I remember it,&#x201d; said Jamie, looking at her from over the table. &#x201c;Although I&#x2019;ve never been there, of course. It all depends on what one means by <i>remember.</i>&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Not that I want to sound too much like you, Isabel.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She smiled; the allusion had not been lost on her. They were playing Free Association, a game they sometimes resorted to when conversation failed, when there was no newspaper or magazine to browse, or when there was simply nothing else to think about. Each would come up with a name of a person or a place, and then the other would describe the thoughts that the word triggered. They had not invented it, of course: Isabel was careful to credit Freud for that, even if there were plenty of other practitioners, including Proust, who, she felt, only had to glance at something before he would be off into several pages of triggered memories.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her reference was to the railway station at which Edward Thomas&#x2019;s train had stopped one day in 1914. Adlestrop&#x2014;seeing the name on the platform sign had prompted the famous poem: the steam hissed; somebody cleared his throat; no one came or left on the bare platform. <i>Yes. I remember Adlestrop </i>was the first line, and this had been what triggered Jamie&#x2019;s response. She was proud of him: few people bothered to remember poetry any more, but Jamie did and could reel off screeds of it. &#x201c;It some�how sticks in my mind,&#x201d; he once said. &#x201c;I just remember it. All sorts of poetry.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Things you learned at school?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He nodded. &#x201c;Especially those. We were encouraged to commit poems to memory. Shakespeare&#x2019;s sonnets, Wordsworth, Byron. The lot. Remember <i>Hiawatha</i>? Longfellow&#x2019;s still there.&#x201d; He smiled at her. &#x201c;Or some of it. <i>On the shores of Gitche Gumee, / Of the shining Big-Sea-Water, / Stood . </i>. .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Nokomis,&#x201d; supplied Isabel. &#x201c;My mother loved that poem and read it all to me&#x2014;all how many stanzas? It goes on forever, doesn&#x2019;t it? Still, Nokomis . . . Now then . . . <i>Stood Nokomis, the old woman, / Pointing with her finger westward . </i>. .&#x201d; She paused as the words, with their insistent, repetitive rhythm, came back to her. She had not thought about Nokomis for a long time. Then she continued, &#x201c;Nokomis sent him off to avenge her father, didn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;She did,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;It was somewhat vindictive of her, don&#x2019;t you feel?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, I think you&#x2019;re being a bit unfair. Nokomis was right to encourage him to deal with Megissogwon who was, after all, <i>Tall of stature, broad of shoulder, / Dark and terrible in aspect, / Clad from head to foot in wampum . . . </i>My goodness, why did I remember that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie laughed. &#x201c;What exactly is wampum? I was never quite sure what the word meant.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Shell beads,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;They were used as money, as well as being worn. You might describe Wall Street brokers as clad in wampum. I suspect they probably are.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But now it was his turn. Leaning back, looking up at the ceiling, he said, &#x201c;Glyndebourne.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel&#x2019;s reply was immediate. It was a rule of Free Association that if you did not reply within ten seconds you lost your turn and the other player had another go. It was a further rule&#x2014;invented by Jamie&#x2014;that if you hesitated twice in a row you had to get up and make tea.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Wagner,&#x201d; she replied.<br>&nbsp;<br>He looked at her. &#x201c;Glyndebourne doesn&#x2019;t make me think of Wagner,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It makes me think of Britten.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She shook her head. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the point of this game, Jamie. You say the first thing that comes into <i>your </i>head, not into somebody else&#x2019;s. And another rule is that you can&#x2019;t argue with the other player&#x2019;s association. If I say &#x2018;Wagner,&#x2019; it&#x2019;s because I thought of Wagner, and your saying &#x2018;Britten&#x2019; counts as a hesita�tion. If you do that again, you have to make us both tea.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He pretended to sulk. &#x201c;Your go, then.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Tea,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Mist,&#x201d; came the reply.<br>&nbsp;<br>She looked at him enquiringly. &#x201c;Why mist?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Now <i>you&#x2019;re </i>arguing.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She defended herself. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not. I&#x2019;m just interested in why you said &#x2018;mist.&#x2019; I&#x2019;m not saying you <i>can&#x2019;t </i>think of mist, I was just wondering why.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s what I see. I thought of a tea estate some�where up in the hills, in Assam, maybe. And I saw women in saris picking tea leaves.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Fair enough.&#x201d; But she was back in Glyndebourne. &#x201c;I thought of Wagner,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;but not any old Wagner. I thought of <i>Die Meistersinger von N�rnberg.</i>&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ah.&#x201d; He looked at her cautiously. He had almost taken a job at Glyndebourne&#x2014;a long time ago, before they married. That road not taken could have been the end of their relation�ship, and they both skirted around the subject.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It was not an unhappy memory.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, years later, they had eventually made it to Glyndebourne together, leaving Charlie in the care of the housekeeper, Grace, who had moved into the house for the weekend. Charlie loved Grace, and she loved him in return, although something in her background&#x2014;something that Isabel could not fathom&#x2014;made her adopt a brisk, and slightly distant, manner with chil�dren. &#x201c;You have to be firm,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;If you aren&#x2019;t, then they&#x2019;ll take advantage. They watch us, you know. They look for the slightest excuse to avoid bedtime.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>They had flown down to Gatwick and then gone to a pub in the Sussex Downs that had rooms at the back for opera-goers and enthusiasts of real ale. The two groups, sitting in the pub, could not have more easily identifiable had they sported large labels. The beer enthusiasts were bearded and loud; the opera-goers, elegantly dressed and feeling out of place, spoke more quietly than they would do later amongst their own in the opera house bar.<br>&nbsp;<br>It was Isabel&#x2019;s first visit to Glyndebourne. She had been invited before, once when she was living in Cambridge and again after she had returned to Edinburgh, but had been unable to make it on either occasion. The second of these invitations had come from her niece, Cat, who had been given two tickets by one of her customers, and had offered to take Isabel with her. When Isabel had been unable to go, Cat had gone with a friend, and had complained about the opera, Tippett&#x2019;s <i>The Knot Garden, </i>which she had not enjoyed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Even Cat, who was musically hard to please, would have luxuriated in <i>The Meistersinger, </i>a rich and spectacular produc�tion. Isabel sat transfixed and had to be prodded by Jamie to return to reality at the interval, when they went off to have din�ner in one of the opera house&#x2019;s restaurants. And at the end, when they went out into the summer night, the sky still light enough for them to read the programme notes, Isabel did not want the evening to end. But Glyndebourne&#x2019;s spell was slow to fade, and it was still upon them when they returned to the room they had booked in the pub, and closed the door and lay together on the lumpy double bed, still in their evening clothes, holding hands like two students newly in love, staring up at the ceiling with its uneven ancient beams of darkened oak. And she thought: <i>How extraordinarily fortunate I am to be here, with him, when my life might have been so different if he had not come into it</i>. She looked at him, and loosened his black bow-tie&#x2014;a gesture that struck her, even as she performed it, as one of ownership. It was a curious feeling&#x2014;one of . . . what? she wondered. Sexual anticipation? The feeling that you have when you realise that you will be sleeping that evening with the person you most want to sleep with in this world.<br>&nbsp;<br>The game of Free Association might have continued had it not been for the sudden eruption of sound from a small monitor perched on the kitchen dresser.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Magnus,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Bottles,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;Endless nappies. Sleepless nights.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie laughed. &#x201c;I had stopped playing Free Association,&#x201d; he said, pointing to the monitor.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; said Isabel, smiling. &#x201c;But I couldn&#x2019;t resist the associations.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Magnus was their second child, who had arrived three months earlier, and who had just signalled that he had woken and was in need of attention. His nap had overlapped with Charlie&#x2019;s; Charlie, although still sleeping, would shortly wake up too and make his presence felt.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Do you remember what it was like?&#x201d; said Jamie, as he rose to his feet.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What what was like?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;When we only had Charlie.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel rolled her eyes. &#x201c;Life was so absurdly simple then.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Not that I&#x2019;d change anything,&#x201d; said Jamie hurriedly. &#x201c;I love them both to bits.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She knew that he did. He loved his two boys to bits, and she loved them that way too. She also loved Jamie to bits, and he had assured her that he loved her to bits. And if an inventory of affection were being made, she thought of so many things she could add to it: their house in Edinburgh, with its shady gar�den and elusive resident, Brother Fox; their city, with its fragile, spiky beauty, its mists and its skies and its romantic history; and her country too, Scotland, with all its curious quirks and its capacity to break the heart again and again.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go and get him up,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll change him if he needs it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll entertain Charlie when he wakes,&#x201d; said Isabel.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How do people who have four or five children cope?&#x201d; asked Jamie.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Or six?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Six!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The older ones look after their younger siblings,&#x201d; said Isa�bel. &#x201c;Look at old photographs. Fifty, sixty years ago. Look at pictures showing children in the street&#x2014;the young ones are holding hands with their older brothers and sisters who are clearly baby-sitting. An eight-year-old would look after a one-year-old, and a six-year-old would look after a four-year-old.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Everybody looked after everybody else, I suppose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They did,&#x201d; agreed Isabel. &#x201c;And did so without complaint.&#x201d;<br><br>The monitor gave a further squawk. &#x201c;Yet they didn&#x2019;t even have monitors,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp;<br>###<br>&nbsp;<br>Magnus&#x2019;s arrival on the stage had been two weeks early, brought about, Jamie half seriously suggested, by Isabel having listened to a foot-tapping piece of music from the Penguin Cafe Orchestra. She had closed her eyes as she listened and then opened them suddenly, wide-eyed at the stab of pain.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her breath had been taken away from her, and it was a few moments before she could speak. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s coming,&#x201d; she said. They had been calling the baby &#x201c;she&#x201d; although they had asked not to be told what sex it was. Yet they were convinced; it would be a daughter this time. They knew they should not make any assumptions, but somehow they felt certain.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie had looked puzzled. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s two weeks . . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She did not let him finish. &#x201c;I need to phone the midwife. I need to let them know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He realised that she was serious. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you to the Infir�mary,&#x201d; he said hurriedly. &#x201c;Grace can look after Charlie. I&#x2019;ll phone her right now.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Isabel held up a hand. &#x201c;Hold on,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll tell me to wait. We&#x2019;ll have hours.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>But she did not have much time. Things happened quickly, and she was in the labour ward within three hours, Magnus appearing twenty minutes later.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A boy,&#x201d; said the obstetrician, passing the glistening infant to a waiting nurse.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie gasped. They had been so sure.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A little boy,&#x201d; muttered Isabel.<br>&nbsp;<br>The nursing staff fussed around the baby before handing him to Isabel, loosely wrapped in an off-white cotton blanket. Swaddling clothes, thought Isabel. But this is loose, and is not proper swaddling.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie cried, wiping at his tears with the back of his hand. They were tears that came with the cathartic welling up of more than one emotion: relief, sheer joy, love. These had all been his companions at the bedside, where he had sat through Isabel&#x2019;s short labour; now they found release. A young nurse in train�ing, attending her first birth, was similarly afflicted, struggling to force back her own tears but finding the battle too much. A senior nurse, standing at her side, whispered something in her ear and touched her briefly on the shoulder.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Are you sure he&#x2019;s a boy?&#x201d; asked Isabel.<br>&nbsp;<br>The obstetrician peeled off his gloves. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been wrong on that one,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>The trainee nurse giggled.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You need to get some sleep,&#x201d; said the senior nurse. She looked at Jamie. &#x201c;Father too.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;We thought it was going to be a girl,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, there you are,&#x201d; said the nurse. &#x201c;You were going to get one or the other, weren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>Isabel held the baby, her cheek pressed lightly against his tiny forehead. She saw that the baby&#x2019;s blanket had letters printed on it, and they suddenly registered. <i>RIP: </i>what a tactless thing to put on a swaddling blanket, but then she noticed that the letters actually said <i>RIE. </i>The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh<i>. </i>That was considerably better. The eye could so easily deceive&#x2014;as when, a few months ago, she had misread a newspaper headline <i>Pope hopes </i>as <i>Pope elopes, </i>and had, for a moment, been both shocked and surprised. Of course now that a pope had broken with long historical practice and retired, it was always possible that a radi�cal successor might feel that the time was ripe to elope. <br>&nbsp;<br>Through the euphoria of the morphine they had given her right at the end, she felt a small niggle of disappointment. She had so wanted a girl, but she knew that she must not allow her�self to think about it. She had a healthy, breathing baby, and that was all that mattered. Perhaps it had been a mistake to remain ignorant of the baby&#x2019;s sex; the sonographers had found out when they performed the ultrasound scans but at her request had delib�erately not shown her the screen. Perhaps she and Jamie should have asked, because that would have prevented their building up hopes. She had wanted a girl because there were things a mother could do with a girl. They would be friends, as mothers and daughters so often are, and would share their world with each other. This was a boy, and it would be like Charlie all over again; not that she regretted anything about him, but the demands of a boy were different.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jamie held her hand. &#x201c;Well done,&#x201d; he whispered.<br><br>She squeezed his hand. &#x201c;Twice as many things for you to do now that he&#x2019;s a boy,&#x201d; she said drowsily, not knowing exactly what she meant, or why she said it.</p><h2>Marin</h2><p><b>Bargain Books are non-returnable.</b> <p>Featuring this popular and photogenic California county just over the Golden Gate Bridge, <i>Marin</i> is finally available in paperback.

Already regarded by many as the most important composer of his generation, Stravinsky is nevertheless at this point a fairly unhappy expatriate, all too aware of the war clouds beginning to gather. Though he still maintains a family life with his wife and children, much of his time is spent with his mistress, Vera Sudeykina, while traveling around Europe giving concerts in order to earn the money to support his dependents&#x2013;which include a number of relatives. Composing, of course, remains the center of his existence. But changes are imminent: within only a few years his wife, Katya, will be dead, his family scattered, and Stravinsky himself, together with Vera, starting over again in America.<br><br><i>Stravinsky: The Second Exile </i>follows the composer through the remainder of his long life, years during which he produces such masterworks as <i>The Rake&#x2019;s Progress</i> and Symphony in C, and achieves a new level of fame as a conductor and raconteur in his own right. With a dazzling command of sources in several languages and a keen feeling for accuracy in situations where truth and falsehood have become blurred, Walsh traces and illuminates Stravinsky&#x2019;s increasingly complex and often agonized family relationships along with his crucially important connection with his associate Robert Craft. Walsh is also, as a musicologist and critic, able to speak with knowledge and wit about Stravinsky&#x2019;s work, expertly describing and assessing the composer&#x2019;s musical journey from the neoclassicism of his late French and early American periods, through his early essays in serial technique, and on finally to the astonishing intricacies of his final compositions.<br><br>The first volume of this biography, <i>Stravinsky: A Creative Spring</i>, was received with glowing praise for its insight, narrative skills, and readability. The period covered here, beset as it is with myths and misconceptions, is handled with even greater authority. <br>Carefully weighed, eloquent, packed with rich and fascinating detail, it casts a brilliant new light on one of the greatest artists of our time.</p><p>Stephen Walsh is a critic and musicologist. He is the author of a number of books on composers ranging from Schumann to Bart�k. The first volume of this biography, <i>Stravinsky</i>: <i>A Creative Spring: Russia and France 1882</i>&#x2013;<i>1934,</i> was published in 1999. Walsh teaches at Cardiff University.<i>Starred Review.</i> In following Igor Stravinsky's journeys from Paris to America and from neoclassicism to serialism, critic and musicologist Walsh concludes his definitive two-volume account of the life of the most acclaimed composer of the 20th century. Details of the composition, performance, recording and reception of the works of this prolific period-neoclassical ones like Oedipus Rex, Orpheus and The Rake's Progress; serialist ones like The Flood, Agon and the Requiem Canticles-absorb the attention of both subject and author. Readers would benefit from some familiarity with Stravinsky's considerable oeuvre, as Walsh comments colorfully on the pieces, but he is mostly concerned with setting the record straight on dates, itineraries, motivations and who said what to whom. In doing so, he often takes issue with Robert Craft, Stravinsky's indispensable assistant, co-conductor and ghostwriter, whose published reminiscences have long stood as the most complete record of the composer's life. Walsh convincingly argues that Craft's intense personal involvement in Stravinsky's life-he describes their relationship as "a miniature ecosystem"-makes him a biased witness or imprecise observer, and Walsh's meticulous consideration makes for a valuable corrective. Amidst all the data, Walsh also demonstrates a gift for lively metaphor that brings his subject to life in flashes-a doer rather than a thinker, a composer devoted to the purity of his art and a perpetually surprising creative genius.

Not a sign of struggle, not a shred of damage, no ransacked cargo&#x2014;and not a trace of the captain, his wife and daughter, or the crew. What happened on board the ghost ship <i>Mary Celeste</i> has baffled and tantalized the world for 130 years. In his stunning new book, award-winning journalist Brian Hicks plumbs the depths of this fabled nautical mystery and finally uncovers the truth. <br><br>The <i>Mary Celeste</i> was cursed as soon as she was launched on the Bay of Fundy in the spring of 1861. Her first captain died before completing the maiden voyage. In London she accidentally rammed and sank an English brig. Later she was abandoned after a storm drove her ashore at Cape Breton. But somehow the ship was recovered and refitted, and in the autumn of 1872 she fell to the reluctant command of a seasoned mariner named Benjamin Spooner Briggs. It was Briggs who was at the helm when the <i>Mary Celeste</i> sailed into history. <br><br>In Brian Hicks&#x2019;s skilled hands, the story of the <i>Mary Celeste</i> becomes the quintessential tale of men lost at sea. Hicks vividly recreates the events leading up to the crew&#x2019;s disappearance and then unfolds the complicated and bizarre aftermath&#x2014;the dark suspicions that fell on the officers of the ship that intercepted her; the farcical Admiralty Court salvage hearing in Gibraltar; the wild myths that circulated after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle published a thinly disguised short story sensationalizing the mystery. Everything from a voodoo curse to an alien abduction has been hauled out to explain the fate of the <i>Mary Celeste</i>. But, as Brian Hicks reveals, the truth is actually grounded in the combined tragedies of human error and bad luck. The story of the <i>Mary Celeste</i> acquired yet another twist in 2001, when a team of divers funded by novelist Clive Cussler located the wreck in a coral reef off Haiti.<br><br>Written with the suspense of a thriller and the vivid accuracy of the best popular history, <i>Ghost Ship</i> tells the unforgettable true story of the most famous and most fascinating maritime mystery of all time.</p><p>"A spellbinding journey into a chilling phenomenon.

Life is often lived in the fast lane, and especially when we are stressed, we tend to use only the upper part of our lungs. We forget to breathe deep down into the stomach and thereby lose out on a lot of energy. Only when you become aware of your breathing and how to train it, you will be able to learn to breathe properly. Your body will immedi�ately absorb more oxygen and after a short time you will have more energy and gain greater mental calmness. Advantages of efficient breathing: Gain more energy in your daily life Become better at managing stress Optimize your work and sport performances Avoid illnesses and get well faster Minimize chronic or transient pain Become happier and more positive Live a healthier and longer life</p><p>Stig Avall Severinsen (born 1973) is a four time World Champion freediver. Freediving consists of diving deep or long while holding your breath. He holds a Master s degree in biology (2001) and a PhD in medicine (2007) from the University of Aarhus, Denmark. During the last decade he has practiced and investigated the beneficial effects of breathing and breath holding on body and mind. Through his company BlueConsult, blueconsult.biz, and his international web community breatheology, he of�fers courses and lectures on efficient breathing and mental training.Now it s an ology Some say he can swim 72m under ice wearing only trunks and goggles (not too many takers for that one, I d imagine). Others swear he can lie face-down in a tank full of sharks and make a lungful of pure oxygen last just over 20 minutes. All we know is that he s the Stig. In fact Danish freediver Stig Avall Severinsen performed both those feats in the space of a month only last year, and we know this not only because he says so but because the Guinness Book of World Records agrees. Stig has also set three AIDA freediving world records (three for dynamic apnea and one, which he held for a year in 2003/4, for constant weight without fins to 61m). The book based on his experience as a freediver, Breatheology, apparently did well in his native country and is now published in English. Breatheology should certainly help freedivers and perhaps scuba-divers too, but it is aimed at everybody, because Stig believes that good control of our breathing is a way of linking body and mind to achieve a tempting range of health and fitness dividends. The book is very well written, and as a biologist with a PhD in medicine, Stig knows his stuff. At the same time, the reader should be prepared to hand in at the door any cynicism about treating this most natural of human functions as a study course, and any resistance you may have to talk of chakras, prana and third eyes. The ways of yoga do, of course, loom large. This is a self-help book containing theory and exercises. Every so often there is a short testimonial from a follower, which is a little off-putting because it reminds you that respiration is, after all, a business for Stig. But if you wish to breathe more easily or more powerfully this is the book for you. Steve Weinman --DIVER UK June 2011<br><br>Those who breathe half, live half , it says on the cover of Stig Avall Severinsen's newly published book "Breatheology The Art of Conscious Breathing". And one is tempted to add: "What's worth doing is worth doing right". Stig's book is an integrated book on a subject that Stig really is an expert on, namely to breathe and hold your breath. We know Stig as a fast-talking freediver, and a man who engages passionately in his interests. He has certainly also been passionate with his new book. One might well have started such a review with the words: "First came the Bible, then the Koran and now "Breatheology". To Stig, breathing is almost like a religion. A good, healthy breathing is good for anything, and the healing powers of breathing are almost unlimited. And this near-religious enthusiasm for breathing is brilliantly reflected in his book. Most of the points and statements are nicely backed by both scientific and practical experience. But it is not the book's greatest force. Its biggest strength is that you can feel Stig's uncompromising enthusiasm for belief in the ability of breathing to generate more energy and other healing properties. You want to join the club and become one of the disciples. You want to become better at using your own breathing. This book is not about freediving, or about accomplishing top performances, nor about holding your breath beyond human limits. This book is about how we all can benefit by focusing on our breath in our daily life. The book is built up on a number of themes. Initially Stig describes how the life of modern man is stressful, and how breathing has become restless and in many cases is not being fully exploited. How good breathing is at reducing stress and creating energy, and how our fast and shallow breathing can have the opposite effect. The book thus begins with the "normality", describing our bad breathing habits in everyday life. Thereafter, the book centers on 5 types of breathing, or perhaps 5 purposes of breathing: trained breathing, sustained breath, powerful breathing, therapeutic breathing and soothing breathing. As a reader, you can easily select the chapters and read them in the sequence you wish. But I recommend that you read the introductory chapters first. The book concludes with a chapter on first aid. It seems a little superficial but ok. After each chapter, Stig describes specific breathing exercises, finely illustrated with excellent drawings and pictures. This exercise catalog is a real force of the book. There are exercises for different purposes ranging from very easy to really difficult. Exercises for everyone. The book is setup nicely with lovely pictures and is printed in a good quality. Of course there are also things that are less good. For example, there is a series of laudatory quotes from happy students who have participated in Stig s courses. Here and there the book's strength, the almost religious belief and enthusiasm, becomes the book's weakness when it gets out of control and becomes too sacred. This happens, for example, when Stig presents recipes for a healthy life. These recipes are as simple as they are right, "eat healthy and exercise" but are sometimes a bit "condescending", not the least when Stig for instance points out that it is important to chew your food slowly, many times and on both sides. We know this the tough part is to get it done. Looking at the book from a sports psychological angle, it is important to emphasize that the book is not a book about performance psychology and mental training. Finally, a simple theme like breathing is material enough for an entire book. the answer is "Yes", for it is not so simple after all. It is both science and religion. --Kristoffer Henriksen (1974) - MD , Sports psychologist and PHD Fellow</p><h2>Millie&#39;s Fiery Trial (Life of Faith, A: Millie Keith Series)</h2><p>The A Life of Faith: Millie Keith novels follow the exciting life and times of Millie Keith, a girl of strong Christian faith growing up on the Indiana frontier in the mid-1800s.

For almost 250 years, Edinburgh was surrounded by a giant defensive wall and, unable to expand its boundaries, it became the most densely populated city in Europe. When buildings could go no higher, people were forced to construct new edifices over the existing structures. An underground slum developed, where subterranean dwellers lived in darkness and abject poverty, ignored by chroniclers of the time. Edinburgh's population eventually came to believe that the city&#x2014;out of sight and out of mind since its abandonment in the mid-19th century&#x2014;had never been there at all. This is the first book to fully chronicle Edinburgh's Town Below the Ground&#x2014;its history and structure, its inhabitants and the lives they led, the story of its rediscovery, the parts that still remain, and the tales that made it legendary.</p><p></p><h2>Fabulously Fast Quilts</h2><p><p>Popular blogger Amy Smart shares the tips and techniques she uses to quickly create complex-looking quilts.

It is they who uncovered the notorious torturer Klaus Barbie, known as &#x201c;the Butcher of Lyon,&#x201d; in Bolivia. It is they who outed Kurt Lischka as chief of the Gestapo in Paris, the man responsible for the largest deportation of French Jews. And it is they who, with the help of their son, Arno, brought the Vichy police chief Maurice Papon to justice. </p><p>They were born on opposite sides of the Second World War. Beate&#x2019;s father was in the Wehrmacht, while Serge&#x2019;s father was deported to Auschwitz because he was a Jew. But when Serge and Beate met on the Paris metro, they instantly fell in love. They soon married and have since dedicated their lives to &#x201c;hunting the truth&#x201d;&#x2015;both as world-famous Nazi hunters and as meticulous documenters of the fate of the innocent French Jewish children who were killed in the death camps. </p><p>They have been jailed and targeted by letter bombs, and their car was even blown up. Yet nothing has daunted the Klarsfelds in their pursuit of justice. Beate made worldwide headlines at age twenty-nine by slapping the high-profile ex&#x2013;Nazi propagandist Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger and shouting &#x201c;Nazi!&#x201d; Serge intentionally provoked a neo-Nazi in a German beer hall by wearing an armband with a yellow star on it, so that the press would report on the assault. When Pope John Paul II met with Austria&#x2019;s then-president, Kurt Waldheim, a former Wehrmacht officer in the Balkans suspected of war crimes, the Klarsfelds&#x2019; son, dressed as a Nazi officer, stood outside the Vatican. The Klarsfelds also dedicated themselves to defeating Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x2019;s National Front and his daughter Marine Le Pen&#x2019;s 2017 campaign for president in France. </p><p>Brave, urgent, and buoyed by a remarkable love story,<i> Hunting the Truth</i> is not only the dramatic memoir of bringing Nazis to justice, it is also the inspiring story of an unrelenting battle against prejudice and hate.</p></p><p><p><b>Beate </b>and<b> Serge </b><b>Klarsfeld</b> are renowned French activists whose work apprehending Nazi war criminals, seeking justice for victims and survivors of war crimes, and establishing the historical record of the Holocaust has brought them international recognition. Recipients of France&#x2019;s Legion of Honor and Germany&#x2019;s Federal Order of Merit, they were named UNESCO Ambassadors of Genocide Prevention by the United Nations in 2015 and were granted honorary Israeli citizenship by the Israeli government in recognition of their support of the Jewish cause. Beate is the recipient of the Jabotinski Prize, and both Beate and Serge have received the HIAS Liberty Award and the Raoul Wallenberg Prize.</p><p><b>Sam Taylor</b> has written for <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>Financial Times</i>, <i>Vogue</i>, and <i>Esquire</i>, and has translated such works as the award-winning <i>HHhH</i> by Laurent Binet; <i>The Heart</i> by Maylis de Kerangal, which won the French-American Foundation Translation Prize and was a finalist for the Albertine Prize; and the internationally bestselling <i>The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair </i>by Jo�l Dicker.</p><p>"Riveting . . . absorbing . . . As their memoirs make clear, these militants of memory never lost sight of their goal." &#x2015;Benjamin Balint, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"Exceptionally relevant . . . an awe-inspiring account of one couple's relentless pursuit of Nazi criminals . . . The Klarsfelds are reluctant memoirists, Serge explains, but their fidelity to accuracy and their humility regarding monumental triumphs of justice serve as urgent messages to us all." &#x2015;Elizabeth Rosner, <i>San Francisco Chronicle </i></p><p>"Assertive . . . <i>Hunting the Truth</i>] helps us understand how these two otherwise ordinary individuals&#x2015;a nonobservant Jewish Frenchman and a gentile German woman&#x2015;came to devote themselves with such single-minded daring to the cause of achieving both justice and commemoration for the French victims of the Holocaust . . . The Klarsfelds&#x2019; success has been undeniable." &#x2015;Robert O. Paxton, <i>The New York Review of Books</i></p><p>"<i>Hunting the Truth</i> is an important book, with an immeasurable educational value. At the narrative level, the authors have written a history primer about the unimaginable cruelty of the Nazis and their willing French collaborators, whom the Klarsfelds helped bring to justice. Alongside the narrative stratum, however, they have compiled a moving treatise based upon their personal experiences." &#x2015;Mordechai Ben-Dat, <i>The Canadian Jewish News</i> </p><p>"A riveting record . . . Anti-semitic hatred, in Sartre&#x2019;s formulation, &#x201c;is first of all a passion.&#x201d; By presenting their many years of struggle for a &#x201c;great, just cause,&#x201d; the Klarsfelds&#x2019; memoir affirms a far higher and more enduring passion." --Peter E. Kornblub, <i>Jewish Book Council</i></p><p>"Remarkable . . . Throughout their harrowing work, [the Klarsfelds] maintained a home in Paris and remain to this day devoted to and inspired by each other. A masterful work of historical importance." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</p><p>"At its best [<i>Hunting the Truth</i>] gives an exhilarating picture of amateurs assuming investigative duties in search of long-overdue justice." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"With bravery and chutzpah, a husband and wife demonstrate that there&#x2019;s no moral compromise with history." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;This inspiring memoir of persistence and staying true to one&#x2019;s beliefs will remind all readers that although it may be slow, justice will triumph.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>"The Klarsfelds, by their assiduous research and documentation, helped in the identification and capture of Nazis and others responsible for those crimes . . .

The Vampire Chronicles continue with a riveting, rich saga--part adventure, part suspense--of Prince Lestat and the story of the Blood Communion as he tells the tale of his coming to rule the vampire world and the eternal struggle to find belonging, a place in the universe for the undead, and how, against his will, he must battle the menacing, seemingly unstoppable force determined to thwart his vision and destroy the entire vampire netherworld. In this spellbinding novel, Lestat, rebel outlaw, addresses the tribe of vampires, directly, intimately, passionately, and tells the mesmerizing story of the formation of the Blood Communion and how he became Prince of the vampire world, the true ruler of this vast realm, and how his vision for all the Children of the Universe to thrive as one, came to be. The tale spills from Lestat&#39;s heart, as he speaks first of his new existence as reigning monarch--and then of his fierce battle of wits and words with the mysterious Rhoshamandes, proud Child of the Millennia, reviled outcast for his senseless slaughter of the legendary ancient vampire Maharet, avowed enemy of Queen Akasha; Rhoshamandes, a demon spirit who refuses to live in harmony at the Court of Prince Lestat and threatens all that Lestat has dreamt of. As the tale unfolds, Lestat takes us from the towers and battlements of his ancestral castle in the snow-covered mountains of France to the verdant wilds of lush Louisiana with its lingering fragrances of magnolias and night jasmine; from the far reaches of the Pacific&#39;s untouched islands to the 18th-century city of St. Petersburg and the court of the Empress Catherine . . .</p><p></p><h2>El Paso Chronicles: A Record of Historical Events in El Paso, Texas</h2><p>A fascinating book in a most unusual way, at El Paso, Texas and its environs.

Kennedy</h2><p>A reexamination of the Mafia&#39;s role in the Kennedy assassination discusses Jack Ruby&#39;s criminal activities and Mafia ties, and how the Warren Commission blatantly covered up the evidence</p><p>Here is a compelling, readable account offering a meticulous, clearly constructed case of Mafia complicity in the assassination of President Kennedy and the murder of his accused assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, by Jack Ruby.

But Oliver North knows better. He was there. Embedded with Marine and Army units for FOX News Channel during Operation Iraqi Freedom, North (himself a decorated combat veteran) vividly tells the story his camera gave us glimpses of during the campaign to liberate Iraq. This updated edition features a new chapter detailing the events after the end of major hostilities&#x2014;including the capture of Saddam Hussein&#x2014;and brand-new action photos straight from the front line.</p><p>This book includes a free DVD featuring the hour-long Fox News Channel episode of Oliver North&#39;s War Stories: Operation Iraqi Freedom.The mainstream media are trying to discredit our victory in Iraq by saying there was no reason to take out Saddam. But Oliver North knows better. He was there. Contrary to some of the media's willing inaccuracies, in War Stories: Operation Iraqi Freedom you'll witness: * How an arsenal was provided to Saddam by so-called friends of the United States * Evidence of equipment used to disperse chemical weapons * The uncovering of huge caches of Iraqi weapons stored in hospitals, schools, and mosques * Evidence of terrorist bases and weapons in Iraq * The connection between captured terrorists and Saddam's regime North sweeps aside the empty secondhand chatter of liberal pundits in this riveting eyewitness account of the heroism, courage, and unflagging patriotism of the American military forces who ended Saddam Hussein's bloody tyranny. Embedded with Marine and Army units for FOX News Channel during Operation Iraqi Freedom, North (himself a decorated combat veteran) vividly tells the story his camera gave us glimpses of during the campaign to liberate Iraq. From the opening seconds of the war-when North witnessed the conflict's first American and British casualties-all the way to the takeover of Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, War Stories lets you see the war in Iraq not as the liberal media wants you to see it, but as it unfolded before the eyes of those who fought it. <p>North gives insights into Operation Iraqi Freedom that only a warrior could provide. And he introduces you to the young warriors who put their lives on the line-the victors who now hope that their stunning triumph won't be stolen by naysayers, critics, and the antiwar crowd. With the authority of an eyewitness and the expertise of a combat veteran, North succinctly skewers the conventional view of the Iraq war, asking simply: "What quagmire?" He unblinkingly refutes accusations of Pentagon planning blunders, shortages of food, fuel, and ammunition, rejection by the Iraqi people, and expectations of huge American casualties. Now that the media establishment's embedded correspondents have returned home, those who have their quills in poison ink have the forum. But Oliver North isn't about to let them rewrite history. He offers here a trustworthy chronicle of the remarkable military force that did nothing less in Iraq than surpass all others in history: no military advance has ever gone so far, so fast, and with so few casualties. 7Filled with North's trademark honest, in-depth, and inspiring reporting, this is a gripping and insightful look at the latest crop of American and coalition heroes-those who fought and won Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p></p><h2>The Fade Out, Vol. 2</h2><p>BRUBAKER &amp; PHILLIPS' newest hit series, THE FADE OUT is an epic noir set in the world of noir itself, the backlots and bars of Hollywood at the end of its Golden Era.

Fremont and the Violent Election of 1856</h2><p>The 1856 presidential race was the most violent peacetime election in American history. War between proslavery and antislavery settlers raged in Kansas; a congressman shot an Irish immigrant at a Washington hotel; and another congressman beat a US senator senseless on the floor of the Senate. But amid all the violence, the campaign of the new Republican Party, headed by famed explorer John C. Fr�mont, offered a ray of hope: a major party dedicated to limiting the spread of slavery. For the first time, women and African Americans actively engaged in a presidential contest, and the candidate&#x2019;s wife, Jessie Benton Fr�mont, played a central role in both planning and executing strategy, and was a public face of the campaign. Even enslaved blacks in the South took hope from Fr�mont&#x2019;s crusade.<br><br>The 1856 campaign was also run against the backdrop of a country on the move, with settlers continuing to spread westward facing unimagined horrors, a terrible natural disaster that took hundreds of lives in the South, and one of the most famous Supreme Court cases in history, which set the stage for the Civil War. Fr�mont lost, but his strong showing in the North proved that a sectional party could win a national election, blazing the trail for Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s victory four years later.</p><p>John Bicknell is the author of <i>America</i><i> 1844: Religious Fervor, Westward Expansion, and the Presidential Election that Transformed the Nation. </i>He has written and edited for Watchdog.org,&nbsp;<i>Congressional Quarterly</i>, and <i>Roll Call</i>, and was senior editor of 2016 and 2018 <i>Almanac of American Politics</i>.

Michelle was away at college now, and she and Carlie still spoke on the phone, but they no longer shared rides to town and the cost of gas on a daily basis.<br><br>The old clunker ate gas like candy and Carlie's salary only stretched so far. She wished she had more than a couple pairs of jeans, a few T-shirts, a coat and one good pair of shoes. It must be nice, she thought, not to have to count pennies. But her father was always optimistic about their status. <em>God loved the poor, because they gave away so much,</em> he was fond of saying. He was probably right.<br><br>Right now, though, her rain-wet jeans were uncomfortable, and she'd stepped in a mud puddle with her only pair of good shoes while she was knocking corrosion off the battery terminals with the hammer she kept under the front seat for that purpose. All this in January weather, which was wet and cold and miserable, even in South Texas.<br><br>Consequently, when she parked her car in the small lot next to the chief's office, she looked like a bedraggled rat. Her dark, short, wavy hair was curling like crazy, as it always did in a rainstorm. Her coat was soaked. Her green eyes, full of silent resignation, didn't smile as she opened the office door.<br><br>Her worst nightmare was standing just inside.<br><br>Carson.<br><br>He glared at her. He was so much taller than she that she had to look up at him. There was a lot to look at, although she tried not to show her interest.<br><br>He was all muscle, but it wasn't overly obvious. He had a rodeo rider's physique, lean and powerful. Like her, he wore jeans, but his were obviously designer ones, like those hand-tooled leather boots on his big feet and the elaborately scrolled leather holster in which he kept his .45 automatic. He was wearing a jacket that partially concealed the gun, but he was intimidating enough without it.<br><br>He was Lakota Sioux. He had jet-black hair that fell to his waist in back, although he wore it in a ponytail usually. He had large black eyes that seemed to see everything with one sweep of his head. He had high cheekbones and a light olive complexion. There were faint scars on the knuckles of his big hands. She noticed because he was holding a file in one of them.<br><br>Her file.<br><br>Well, really, the chief's file, that had been lying on her desk, waiting to be typed up. It referenced an attack on her father a few weeks earlier that had resulted in Carlie being stabbed. Involuntarily, her hand went to the scar that ran from her shoulder down to the beginning of her small breasts. She flushed when she saw where he was looking.<br><br>"Those are confidential files," she said shortly.<br><br>He looked around. "There was nobody here to tell me that," he said, his deep voice clear as a bell in the silent room.<br><br>She flushed at the implied criticism. "Damned truck wouldn't start and I got soaked trying to start it," she muttered. She slid her weather-beaten old purse under her desk, ran a hand through her wet hair, took off her ratty coat and hung it up before she sat down at her desk. "Did you need something?" she asked with crushing politeness. She even managed a smile. Sort of.<br><br>"I need to see the chief," he replied.<br><br>She frowned. "There's this thing called a door. He's got one," she said patiently. "You knock on it, and he comes out."<br><br>He gave her a look that could have stopped traffic.<br><br>"There's somebody in there with him," he said with equal patience. "I didn't want to interrupt."<br><br>"I see." She moved things around on her desk, muttering to herself.<br><br>"Bad sign."<br><br>She looked up. "Huh?"<br><br>"Talking to yourself."<br><br>She glared at him. It had been a bad morning altogether and he wasn't helping. "Don't listen, if it bothers you."<br><br>He gave her a long look and laughed hollowly. "Listen, kid, nothing about you bothers me. Or ever will."<br><br>There were the sounds of chairs scraping wood, as if the men in Cash's office had stood up and pushed back their seats. She figured it was safe to interrupt him.<br><br>Well, safer than listening to Mr. Original American here run her down.<br><br>She pushed the intercom button. "You have a visitor, sir," she announced.<br><br>There was a murmur. "Who is it?"<br><br>She looked at Carson. "The gentleman who starts fires with hand grenades," she said sweetly.<br><br>Carson stared at her with icy black eyes.<br><br>Cash's door opened, and there was Carlie's father, a man in a very expensive suit and Cash.<br><br>That explained why her father had left home so early. He was out of town, as he'd said he would be; out of Comanche Wells, where they lived, anyway. Not that Jacobsville was more than a five-minute drive from home.<br><br>"Carson," Cash said, nodding. "I think you know Reverend Blair and my brother, Garon?"<br><br>"Yes." Carson shook hands with them.<br><br>Carlie was doing mental shorthand. Garon Grier was senior special agent in charge of the Jacobsville branch of the FBI. He'd moved to Jacobsville some time ago, but the FBI branch office hadn't been here quite as long. Garon had been with the bureau for a number of years.<br><br>Carlie wondered what was going on that involved both the FBI and her father. But she knew that question would go unanswered. Her father was remarkably silent on issues that concerned law enforcement, although he knew quite a few people in that profession.<br><br>She recalled with a chill the telephone conversation she'd had recently with someone who called and said, "Tell your father he's next." She couldn't get anybody to tell her what they thought it meant. It was disturbing, like the news she'd overheard that the man who'd put a knife in her, trying to kill her father, had been poisoned and died.<br><br>Something big was going on, linked to that Wyoming murder and involving some politician who had ties to a drug cartel. But nobody told Carlie anything.<br><br>"Well, I'll be off. I have a meeting in San Antonio," Reverend Blair said, taking his leave. He paused at Carlie's desk. "Don't do anything fancy for supper, okay?" he asked, smiling. "I may be very late."<br><br>"Okay, Dad." She grinned up at him.<br><br>He ruffled her hair and walked out.<br><br>Carson was watching the interplay with cynical eyes.<br><br>"Doesn't your dad ruffle your hair?" she asked sarcastically.<br><br>"No. He did lay a chair across it once." He averted his eyes at once, as if the comment had slipped out against his will and embarrassed him.<br><br>Carlie tried not to stare. What in the world sort of background did he come from? The violence struck a chord in her. She had secrets of her own from years past.<br><br>"Carson," Garon Grier said, pausing at the door. "We may need you at some point."<br><br>Carson nodded. "I'll be around."<br><br>"Thanks."<br><br>Garon waved at his brother, smiled at Carlie and let himself out the door.<br><br>"Something perking?" Carson asked Cash.<br><br>"Quite a lot, in fact. Carlie, hold my calls until I tell you," he instructed.<br><br>"Sure thing, Boss."<br><br>"Come on in." Cash went ahead into his office.<br><br>Carson paused by Carlie's desk and glared at her.<br><br>She glared back. "If you don't stop scowling at me, I'm going to ask the chief to frisk you for hand grenades," she muttered.<br><br>"Frisk me yourself," he dared softly.<br><br>The flush deepened, darkened.<br><br>His black eyes narrowed, because he knew innocence when he saw it; it was that rare in his world. "Clueless, aren't you?" he chided.<br><br>She lifted her chin and glared back. "My father is a minister," she said with quiet pride.<br><br>"Really?"<br><br>She frowned, cocking her head. "Excuse me?"<br><br>"Are you coming in or not?" Cash asked suddenly, and there was a bite in his voice.<br><br>Carson seemed faintly surprised. He followed Cash into the office. The door closed. There were words spoken in a harsh tone, followed by a pause and a suddenly apologetic voice.<br><br>Carlie paid little attention. Carson had upset her nerves. She wished her boss would find someone else to talk to. Her job had been wonderful and satisfying until Carson started hanging around the office all the time. Something was going on, something big. It involved local and federal law enforcement&#x2014;she was fairly certain that the chief's brother didn't just happen by to visit&#x2014;and somehow, it also involved her father.<br><br>She wondered if she could dig any information out of her parent if she went about it in the right way. She'd have to work on that.<br><br>Then she recalled that phone call that she'd told her father about, just recently. A male voice had said, simply, "Tell your father, he's next." It had been a chilling experience, one she'd forced to the back of her mind. Now she wondered if all the traffic through her boss's office involved her in some way, as well as her father. The man who'd tried to kill him had died, mysteriously poisoned.<br><br>She still wondered why anybody would attack a minister. That remark of Carson's made her curious. She'd said her father was a minister and he'd said, "Really?" in that sarcastic, cold tone of voice. Why?<br><br>"I'm a mushroom," she said to herself. "They keep me in the dark and feed me manure." She sighed and went back to work.<br><br>She was on the phone with the sheriff's office when Carson left. He went by her desk with only a cursory glance at her, and it was, of all things, placid. Almost apologetic. She lowered her eyes and refused to even look at him.<br><br>Even if she'd found him irresistible&#x2014;and she was trying not to&#x2014;his reputation with women made her wary of him.<br><br>Sure, it was a new century, but Carlie was a small-town girl and raised religiously. She didn't share the casual attitude of many of her former classmates about physical passion.<br><br>She grimaced. It was hard to be a nice girl when people treated her like a disease on legs. In school, they'd made fun of her, whispered about her. One pretty, popular girl said that she didn't know what she was missing and that she should live it up.<br><br>Carlie just stared at her and smiled. She didn't say anything. Apparently the smile wore the other girl down because she shrugged, turned her back and walked off to whisper to the girls in her circle. They all looked at Carlie and laughed.<br><br>She was used to it. Her father said that adversity was like grit, it honed metal to a fine edge. She'd have liked to be honed a little less.<br><br>They were right about one thing; she really didn't know what she was missing. It seemed appropriate, because she'd read about sensations she was supposed to feel with men around, and she didn't feel any of them.<br><br>She chided herself silently. That was a lie. She felt them when she was close to Carson. She knew that he was aware of it, which made it worse. He laughed at her, just the way her classmates had laughed at her in school. She was the odd one out, the misfit. She had a reason for her ironclad morals. Many local people knew them, too. Episodes in her childhood had hardened her.<br><br>Well, people tended to be products of their upbringing. That was life. Unless she wanted to throw away her ideals and give up religion, she was pretty much settled in her beliefs. Maybe it wasn't so bad being a misfit. Her late grandfather had said that civilizations rested on the bedrock of faith and law and the arts. Some people had to be conventional to keep the mechanism going.<br><br>"What was that?" Sheriff Hayes's receptionist asked.<br><br>"Sorry." Carlie cleared her throat. She'd been on hold. "I was just mumbling to myself. What were you saying?"<br><br>The woman laughed and gave her the information the chief had asked for, about an upcoming criminal case.<br><br>She cooked a light supper, just creamed chicken and rice, with green peas, and made a nice apple pie for dessert.<br><br>Her father came in, looking harassed. Then he saw the spread and grinned from ear to ear. "What a nice surprise!"<br><br>"I know, something light. But I was hungry," she added.<br><br>He made a face. "Shame. Telling lies."<br><br>She shrugged. "I went to church Sunday. God won't mind a little lie, in a good cause."<br><br>He smiled. "You know, some people have actually asked me how to talk to God."<br><br>"I just do it while I'm cooking, or working in the yard," Carlie said. "Just like I'm talking to you."<br><br>He laughed. "Me, too. But there are people who make hard work of it."<br><br>"Why were you in the chief's office today?" she asked suddenly He paused in the act of putting a napkin in his lap. His expression went blank for an instant, then it came back to life. "He wanted me to talk to a prisoner for him," he said finally.<br><br>She raised both eyebrows.<br><br>"Sorry," he said, smoothing out the napkin. "Some things are confidential."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>"Let's say grace," he added.</p><h2>Hope Unseen: The Story of the U.S. Army&#39;s First Blind Active-Duty Officer</h2><p><b>The inspiring, unflinching true story of &#x201c;blind&#x201d; faith, as Major Scotty Smiley awakes in a hospital bed and realizes his world is permanently dark he must stretch his faith like never before.

The climbing guides issued it as an edict. &#x201c;If you need to go, use the restroom over there&#x2014;this snow doubles as a source of water at ten thousand feet. None of us wants to go redrinking yesterday&#x2019;s grape Gatorade after it spends the night in your bladder.&#x201d; Easy for them to say. &#x201c;Over there&#x201d; was no big deal when you could see. But for a blind guy? I might as well walk to Boise to take a pee; I had zero chance to make it two hundred meters. I had stuck a lot of unwanted things in my mouth during the last eight hundred or so days of darkness, so what was wrong with a tiny taste of lemon snow for a few people who could still see?<br> <br>The decision quickly became a dilemma. I follow rules. But to pee properly I needed help. I had been superexcited when the guide told our group that we would be waking up at eleven in preparation for the climb to the summit. It was just 9 P.M. Fourteen hours of sleep? Simply awesome. It was smart to allow us rest before we ascended the final four-thousand-plus vertical feet to the fifth-highest point in the continental United States. But my joy was soon turned to frustration: the guide explained that we would be arising at 11 P.M. Two hours? I don&#x2019;t mess around with sleep patterns&#x2014;even if my life now exists in a perpetual nighttime.<br> <br>By the time I decided that I could no longer hold it, the rest of the climbing team was knocked out. If I woke anyone up, I&#x2019;d be robbing him of probably half his night&#x2019;s rest. In a departure from my normal worldview, I became a utilitarian. The odds that someone would actually happen upon my urine were extremely low&#x2014;the Mariners winning the World Series low. Compare those minuscule odds and their minimal impact with the guarantee someone would lose sleep if I shook him awake, and the answer became clear.<br> <br>At just after 10 P.M., 10,100 feet above Enumclaw and Yakima and Fort Lewis&#x2014;feet freezing and teeth chattering&#x2014;I peed in the snow just a few steps behind the tent. Really, the dilemma was less about me stealing anyone&#x2019;s sleep and more about how much I hate&#x2014;how much I really despise&#x2014;my childlike dependency on others. With more than two years of blindness under my belt, maybe I should have been used to it, but I wasn&#x2019;t. Being helpless in certain circumstances never gets easy. The pain dulls a bit. But it&#x2019;s a lifelong challenge.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s difficult to admit, because I like to think of myself as noncompetitive, but the truth is I want to be the best at every endeavor I undertake. Deep down I want to march the fastest, pin the quickest, shoot with the most deadly accuracy, marry the prettiest girl, and climb the highest mountains. That&#x2019;s what happens when you grow up with three brothers and three sisters. You hone your quickness fighting for extra dessert. You build strength and awareness guarding your space in the car. My life growing up was a constant competition, and losing wasn&#x2019;t any fun. So I grew up trying to be the best.<br> <br>When Micah Clark, the founder of Camp Patriot, invited me on the Mount Rainier climb, I responded by asking him if he knew just exactly who (or what) he was talking to. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see, Micah.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>I can&#x2019;t.</i> I still trembled every time those words rolled off my tongue.<br> <br><i>I can&#x2019;t.</i> I won&#x2019;t testify with certainty, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure I never even used those words before the injury. I had won a state football championship&#x2014;as part of a team of undersized farm boys and wannabes, none of whom went on to play for a Division I school. I graduated from West Point with a decent grade point. I married my beautiful high school sweetheart. I completed Ranger School, and I set my sights on army Special Operations. I feel like I&#x2019;m a pretty tough guy. I spent my first twenty-four years tackling life head-on with a pretense of invulnerability, pounding life&#x2019;s obstacles into the turf and standing over them, satisfied, with mouth guard in hand. <i>I can&#x2019;t. Because I can&#x2019;t see Micah.</i><br> <br>&#x201c;I know you can&#x2019;t see, Scotty. But you can do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Micah Clark dreamed up Camp Patriot while fly-fishing in Montana after a three-month stint as a security contractor in Afghanistan. The luxury of a month in solitude&#x2014;with just his log cabin, his fly rod, and a stream&#x2014;convinced him that he should do something more for those who had returned from war a little less whole than when they had departed. He believed that outdoor adventures would be therapeutic for wounded vets, so he took a two-hour trip through <i>Non Profits for Dummies</i> and launched a dream that continues to shift the paradigm for many of our nation&#x2019;s most giving servants: <i>I can still be me.</i><br> <br>With Micah&#x2019;s encouragement, I managed to get over &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t&#x201d; and agreed to do the climb. Standard climbs up Rainier involve parking a van at about five thousand feet and then a day&#x2019;s walk to double that elevation. There is no real technical climbing involved in the first portion of the journey&#x2014;not even any snow until a few thousand feet up from the lot. The climactic moment of the first day came when another wounded vet and I crossed Pebble Creek. The creek crossing was nothing more than an exercise in staying dry for people with both eyes or both legs, but it proved a challenge for me. Michael Perry, a writer who joined us on the climb and later published an article in <i>Backpacker</i> magazine, described the dynamics: &#x201c;When they complete the crossing, there are congratulations and smiles all around, but the cheerleading is contained. Everyone is working out the line between encouragement and patronization. The men simply crossed a small creek.&#x201d;<br> <br>Compared to all the ruck marches I had done as an infantryman, the climb to base camp had not been all that difficult. Foolishly, I announced that to the group, prompting a quick and unfriendly &#x201c;Shut up, Scotty&#x201d; from an exhausted fellow climber. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you try it on one leg?&#x201d; was his remark. In no way was I reveling in my partner&#x2019;s struggles. To the contrary, I sheepishly apologized to him for my thoughtless comment. But the ease of the movement to base camp&#x2014;forty-pound backpack and all&#x2014;had emboldened me.<br> <br>The next day, two hours into the ascent from Camp Muir, my confidence had vanished, and I was vehemently disagreeing with Micah. I was not sure if I could keep going. Micah Clark&#x2014;as I remembered him from our years growing up in Pasco, Washington&#x2014;was an attractive guy, a human rock with a stomach that looked like German hedgerows. When I was a summer lifeguard, he would come to the pool to work out; he was training to become a Navy SEAL.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d once been in pretty good shape myself, but Ranger School and my levels of peak fitness were distant memories. Being blind made physical training a struggle. I found it tough to run up hills or to ride a bike. I found the monotony of pounding the pavement without the benefit of passing scenery too much to bear. And so my lungs were not the same as they had once been.<br> <br>In addition to my burning lungs, both of my calves were ablaze. I wanted to quit. I wanted an hour to hydrate. I was breathing like a chain smoker. I was mentally pummeled. I hoisted the cement pillars that were now my legs up the mountain one deliberate motion at a time. Every single step took Jedi-like concentration, tying my neck and shoulders in taut knots. I had no idea what each succeeding takeoff and landing of my foot would bring. Entertaining the notion that I might make it to the top, I considered the number of steps I still had to take. What was left? Thirty-five hundred feet? The equivalent of eight thousand more stairs? Except that climbing was entirely unlike walking up some steps and a lot more like navigating an angry, oscillating escalator&#x2014;in the wrong direction and with pieces of metal ready to jab my ankles at any moment.<br> <br>In my head, I scolded myself. <i>Why did you agree to do this? Why did you say yes?</i> How was I going to make it to the top&#x2014;and then back down again? When we paused for a break, I called out for my escort: &#x201c;Curtis, I&#x2019;m not sure I can keep going.&#x201d; I no longer believed I had any chance to summit the mountain.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see how you feel on the next stop, Scotty.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>This guy&#x2019;s not listening to me.</i> I made myself a bit clearer: &#x201c;Curtis, you don&#x2019;t understand. I don&#x2019;t think I can make it. You guys, um, you guys see these amazing views. You have some motivation to overcome the pain. Me, I don&#x2019;t see anything. I can&#x2019;t see anything. I don&#x2019;t know how much longer I can go.&#x201d;<br> <br>Curtis handed me a Snickers, some M&amp;M&#x2019;s, and a Propel. &#x201c;Here you go, Scotty. We&#x2019;ll see how you&#x2019;re doing at the next stop.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure how candy and flavored water were going to fix my fatigued body and my dwindling desire. In fact, I wasn&#x2019;t sure what was going to get me back on my feet. I had been in this spot so many times in the last couple of years. When I woke up from the blast in Iraq and couldn&#x2019;t see a thing, every single step became that much harder. It took determination to get out of bed and just take a shower. It took every ounce of me to learn how to send an e-mail. Daily, I had to make choices to continue on or to sit on the couch with my feet up and listen to the television. When I lost my sight, the linebacker who tackled life head-on&#x2014;that guy was knocked down. If a blind person tackles life head-on, he runs into things: lampposts, doors, other people. There are lots of things I <i>can&#x2019;t</i> do. But there were also lots of things I could still accomplish. I had surfed in Hawaii and skied in Vail. I was about to become a graduate student at Duke University. My life was not as easy as before. Many things were hard. I was learning how to dig deep and fight for things in a new way. And yet, as I sat there on Mount Rainier, I just didn&#x2019;t think I could do <i>this.</i><br> <br><br> <br>Two years prior to Rainier, and just three months after losing the use of both of my eyes while fighting the war on terror in Mosul, Iraq, I hit bottom with this battle to persevere. I was struggling to believe that God was still God. I know now that the God who loved me before the injury loved me just as much afterward. The God I hoped in but could not see was the same God I now hoped in despite being able to see nothing at all. But crumpled on a cement slab, in the vicinity of the V.A. Blind Rehabilitation Center in Palo Alto, California, I no longer understood what God wanted from me.<br> <br><i>What am I supposed to do with this life? Who am I?</i><br> <br>Somewhere along the sidewalk that led to the door of the blind center, my stick had missed a mat. I knew the whole route by heart&#x2014;had committed it to memory in just a week. Coming out of the gym, I felt around for a metal drainage grate. The grate was maybe twenty feet from the door, just an inch or two to the right of the five-foot-wide cement strip that kept me on course. The xylophone tinging of the grate told me to turn right. Another twenty feet took me to the first black mat&#x2014;three feet long and five feet wide; the rubber marker told me to take another left. About thirty feet after that turn, I would cross a small driveway&#x2014;a twenty-foot journey without the benefit of paralleling borders that required me to shoot my own straight arrow to the other side. It was my own personal game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey. Once across the driveway, I would use my stick to again find the sidewalk and resume the &#x201c;easy&#x201d; part of my travels.<br> <br>As best I can remember, I connected all of those dots precisely. Crossing the driveway had the most dramatic impact on my nerves. Parking lots were a blind man&#x2019;s outer space. No up, no down. No left, no right. Just an empty wasteland of concrete that could quickly induce massive disorientation.<br> <br>Whenever I made it those twenty feet, I breathed a sigh of relief, and on that particular day, I specifically remember exhaling. So it must have been the final waypoint that I missed. My walking stick&#x2019;s next encounter with a black mat meant I would turn right and proceed ten feet until I heard the sound of two automatic doors swinging open. But two minutes after crossing that driveway, I hadn&#x2019;t hit a mat. The stretch to the mat was not really that far&#x2014;thirty yards and maybe thirty seconds on a normal day. But two minutes? I figure I must have walked a football field. What was the stupid stick for if it couldn&#x2019;t find the mat? I raged against the idea of what I must have looked like with that stick&#x2014;a spectacle for sure. I was so angry with myself, with the situation, with my pathetic life that I stepped off the sidewalk in defiance. If I had learned one thing in the first week of mobility school, it was &#x201c;Never leave the sidewalk.&#x201d; <i>Forget it. I can do this.</i> I stepped into space and floated toward the moon.<br> <br>What I didn&#x2019;t know&#x2014;because Tiffany was carefully picking her battles with me&#x2014;was that the blue-and-white hockey helmet protecting my brain from a blow to the soft part of my head came with a rainbow-colored chinstrap. I was a triangle-headed man with a stick that shouted, <i>I can&#x2019;t see,</i> and I wasn&#x2019;t even aware that it was all made worse by a chinstrap that announced my support for Skittles, trips to Hawaii, or a San Francisco parade. I wouldn&#x2019;t know until weeks later when my friend Adam Rivette visited. Tiffany stood across the room, waving her arms for Adam to be quiet, as Adam asked the obvious question. &#x201c;Scotty, dude, what&#x2019;s with the rainbow chinstrap?&#x201d; After Tiffany&#x2019;s sister Michelle hesitantly stuck her toe into the fray and confirmed that Adam wasn&#x2019;t just messing with me, I ripped off the helmet and chucked it across the room.<br> <br>I had never been to Palo Alto as a sighted person.

But sweltering between the mid-July California sun and the radiating pavement&#x2014;drifting listlessly in that lot&#x2014;I grew desperate. The blackness, the warmth, and a growing dizziness induced a panic beyond any other that I had ever endured. Before lifting weights at the V.A.&#x2019;s eighties-era gym, I had neglected to drink any water. I could feel my sweat glands drying up&#x2014;searching my body in vain for moisture&#x2014;as I wandered aimlessly, probing for something, anything, that might reestablish my bearings. It was dark. It seemed empty. I felt hopeless.<br> <br>I fought to stay conscious. Like a bat, I hurled sound waves, shouting &#x201c;hello&#x201d; in multiple directions (or what I thought were multiple directions), attuning my ears to any potential echo.

Many prophesied or prayed that his election heralded a postracial America. But everything about Obama is widely, insistently, almost unavoidably interpreted through the prism of race&#x2014;his appearance (light-skinned), his demeanor (<i>not </i>an angry black man), his diction (&#x201c;articulate,&#x201d; &#x201c;no Negro dialect&#x201d;), his spouse (dark-skinned), the support he enjoys (anchored by blacks), the opposition he encounters (constituted overwhelmingly by whites). <br>&nbsp;<br>For Obama himself, the consciousness of race is ever-present. It was evident on Election Night when he remarked on the miraculousness of an African American winning the White House. It was evident at the inauguration when he alluded to the fact that, during his father&#x2019;s lifetime, bigotry denied blacks service in Washington, D.C., restaurants. It was evident at the press conference of December 7, 2010, when, defending hotly disputed tax legislation, he maintained that compromise was central to America, including the Founding Fathers&#x2019; compromise with slavery&#x2014;a bargain that some thoughtful observers have condemned as immoral.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was a time&#x2014;now it seems long ago&#x2014;when it appeared, momentarily, that America had taken a giant stride toward redemption. After all, the electorate selected Barack Hussein Obama, a black man, to be president of the United States. The hope, pride, relief, and astonishment generated by this unprecedented event provoked all sorts of optimistic declarations. People who had, in emotional self- defense, habitually eschewed patriotism, now waved American flags enthusiastically. People who had doubted that Americans would ever be able to overcome racial alienation now believed that they could. Expressions of exhilaration produced sounds and scenes reminiscent of reactions to such landmark events as the Emancipation Proclamation, Joe Louis&#x2019;s victory over Max Schmeling; the &#x201c;I Have a Dream&#x201d; speech of Martin Luther King, Jr.; and the landing on the moon. Parties erupted featuring such anthems as &#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t No Stoppin&#x2019; Us Now,&#x201d; &#x201c;A Change is Gonna Come,&#x201d; and &#x201c;We&#x2019;re a Winner.&#x201d; Strangers danced and cried with one another. People named newborns after the president-elect. On the day after the election, one of my students at Harvard Law School tearfully declared that in light of Obama&#x2019;s election she was reconsidering her career plans. His example, she said, made her want to be a better person. A few days later, I received a letter from an inmate of a maximum-security prison in Indiana that said the same thing. <br>&nbsp;<br>On Election Night one heard repeatedly echoes of Maya Angelou&#x2019;s statement &#x201c;I never thought I&#x2019;d see a black president in the White House in my lifetime.&#x201d; Oprah Winfrey exclaimed that Election Night was &#x201c;the most electrifying&#x201d; moment she had ever experienced. People commonly remarked that they felt as if they were dreaming. The day after the election, on a Listserv organized by racial- minority law professors, a distinguished black jurist remarked, &#x201c;When I woke up this morning, I said to my husband, &#x2018;I had the weirdest dream last night. I dreamed that a black man named Barack Hussein Obama became president of the United States. Is that weird or what?&#x2019; &#x201d; <br>&nbsp;<br>Blacks were not the only ones feeling and expressing pent-up emotion. Responding to a column in which the black journalist Eugene Robinson explained why he wept on Election Night, numbers of white readers noted that they, too, had been moved to tears. In an open &#x201c;Letter to a New Neighbor,&#x201d; Washingtonian Betsy Karasik poured out feelings of gratitude:<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>You proved that Americans are not nearly as narrow-minded as most of us believed; that speaking to us adult-to-adult about race trumps playing the race card; that sticking to the issues and taking the high road do not make you a sucker; that being an intellectual is not a liability . . . and that appealing to the best in people brings out the young, the old, the dissatisfied, minorities and even the opposition in record numbers.</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>In newspapers and Web sites people posted messages by the thousands displaying ways in which Obama&#x2019;s victory deeply moved them. A reader of <i>The Washington Post </i>wrote, &#x201c;We still have a long way to go to erase the sin of slavery and end racism. But maybe, just maybe, this is the beginning of the end of race as a major issue. Today, I can truly say, God Bless America, and mean it.&#x201d; A reader of <i>The New York Times </i>stated that Obama&#x2019;s election &#x201c;does nothing less for me than heal my chronic young boyhood wound of November 22, 1963&#x201d;&#x2014;the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. &#x201c;And also the wounds of Bobby and Martin&#x201d;&#x2014;the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., in the spring of 1968. A reader of the Web site Jack &amp; Jill Politics wrote, &#x201c;This morning I woke up and realized that what I saw last night was not a dream. . . . I realized I woke up in a new time, in a new era. I woke up in A.B.&#x2014;After Barack.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Euphoric statements made in the grip of the postelection high are painful (and sometimes embarrassing) to recall. Even seasoned observers were swept up by a delusionary millenarianism. Many racial Panglossians, however, have been sobered by realities&#x2014;the substantial number of Americans who simply refuse to acknowledge Obama&#x2019;s political legitimacy (for example, the allegation believed by tens of millions that he was born abroad), the open contempt displayed by antagonists not only on the airwaves of right-wing talk radio but also in the inner sanctum of Congress (for example, Joe Wilson&#x2019;s infamous shout of &#x201c;You lie!&#x201d;), and the stark polarization that characterizes the racial demographics of support for and opposition to Obama. That the opposition is overwhelmingly white is a fact that no one can reasonably dispute. What is disputed, however, is that racial sentiment is an important ingredient in the opposition. &#x201c;America has turned the page on race,&#x201d; wrote a correspondent for <i>The Economist</i>. &#x201c;The electorate may be divided by race, but no longer mainly because of race.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>It is, of course, true that there are many potential nonracial reasons for rejecting Obama, including disagreement with his domestic policies (his stance on abortion, financial regulation, immigration, taxation, etc.), foreign policy (his prosecution of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, for instance), and also objections to Obama himself. Even some who formerly supported him enthusiastically have subsequently voiced doubts about his mettle as a leader. Racial sentiments, moreover, are devilishly difficult to isolate and quantify in specific instances. In gross, however, the evidence is overwhelming, that racial attitudes affect judgments pervasively&#x2014;from the administration of justice to support or opposition to social welfare programs, to dating and the marriage market, to employment decisions. African Americans, for in stance, are not only discriminated against in many settings; they are more discriminated against the blacker they are perceived to be. Against that backdrop, it is wholly implausible to think that racial attitudes would not significantly affect assessments of politicians.<br>&nbsp;<br>That Obama won the White House in 2008 does not mean that racial prejudice is no longer a potent force in American politics. The political scientists Michael Tesler and David O. Sears argue persuasively that the election of 2008 &#x201c;was anything but postracial. Instead, the racial hopes and fear evoked by [Obama&#x2019;s] potential to become the country&#x2019;s first black president sharply divided racial conservatives from racial liberals. Public opinion and voting behavior . . . were considerably more polarized by racial attitudes than at any other time on record.&#x201d; Racial attitudes, they conclude, are &#x201c;one of the most important determinants of how the American public responded.&#x201d; &nbsp;Racial liberals supported Obama more than they would have backed an ideologically similar white candidate while racial conservatives opposed Obama more than they would have opposed an ideologically similar white candidate. Furthermore, there are some who voted for Obama in 2008 <i>despite </i>their disinclination to vote for a black candidate. It should be unsurprising that they would turn against him more quickly and sharply than they would have done under identical circumstances if he were white. <br>&nbsp;<br>The 2008 postelection racial euphoria stemmed from an array of sources, including denial of the breadth, depth, and subtlety of racial divisions in American life. Despite the epochal nature of the election, it should have been understood from the outset that something as thoroughly ingrained as American racial prejudice, particularly its antiblack variant, would not suddenly dissipate despite the goodwill effectively summoned by Obama&#x2019;s skillful campaign. Much of what he had to surmount in order to win was rooted in America&#x2019;s racial traumas. He had to overcome doubts lodged deep in the psyches of blacks, some of whom were so afraid of the lengths to which they thought whites would go to prevent the election of a black president that early on they refrained from supporting him, convinced that he would be assassinated if he emerged as a serious contender. He had to overcome Negrophobia that made it difficult, if not impossible, for some whites to vote in favor of entrusting a black man with the fate of the nation&#x2014;regardless of the caliber of the white alternatives. A wide variety of biases confronted Obama&#x2014;from paranoia about his origins and loy...</p></p><h2>Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracles of Ages: The Official Nintendo Player&#39;s Guide</h2><p>The Legend of Zelda Oracle of Seasons and The Legend of Zelda Oracle of Ages Complete strategies for both games</p><p></p><h2>Xanadu Talisman (Modesty Blaise)</h2><p>In this classic return we see Modesty both at her most feminine and at her toughest.

Their quest takes them from Tangier to Paris, from the Riviera to Corsica, and finally to a stronghold in the heart of the Atlas Mountains, their every move observed and manipulated by El Mico, the most notorious and dangerous criminal genius in the Mediterranean. Unknown to Modesty, she holds a secret that El Mico covets above all else, and she is brought to a final confrontation with death in the stronghold of Xanadu. As in all the Modesty Blaise stories, this book is peopled with a host of eccentric characters: the engaging Dr. Giles Pennyfeather, Modesty&#39;s devoted friend, and her opponents Little Krell, a prodigy in combat, the Silk brothers, juvenile adults who deal in death, and the astonishing Nanny Prendergast.</p><p><b>Peter O'Donnell</b> created the Modesty Blaise strip cartoon in the 1950s and is the author of 13 books in the Modesty Blaise novel series.<br>&#x201c;[Modesty Blaise and Willie Gavin's is] one of the greatest partnerships in crime fiction . . . bearing comparison (though necessarily different from) that of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2014;Kingsley Amis</p><h2>The Handmade Alphabet</h2><p>Presents the handshape for each letter of the American manual alphabet accompanied by an object whose name begins with that letter</p><p><b>Laura Rankin</b> is the creator of&nbsp;<i>The Handmade Alphabet</i>, a&nbsp;<i>Boston Globe-Horn Book</i>&nbsp;Honor Book, and&nbsp;<i>Ruthie and the (Not So) Teeny Tiny Lie</i>.

She lives in Easton, Maryland.From a hand grasping two asparagus stalks to a zippered sleeve tracing the letter Z, Rankin's alphabet book is a glorious success as it displays the American Sign Language alphabet. The colored pencil illustrations on charcoal paper of varied hues depict one letter on each page--a pencil's eraser rubs away at a hand that signs the letter E , an icicle is balanced on a pinky, a muscular hand makes a V while holding a valentine. The hands here are as diverse and individual as the objects surrounding them--a baby's chubby fingers grip plastic keys, matronly hands with magenta-polished nails form the letter N , vivid bones of a hand, seen in an X-ray, show off X . Rankin's prefatory note describes how her deaf stepson "gained more thorough undertanding and total communication" when he learned sign language at Gallaudet University.

He was a lean, hook-nosed American from Boston, his frock coat black and his felt top hat set at a jaunty angle. "Very bad!"<br>Cooper's partner, Wilf Tillman, stiffened slightly, feeling the underlying edge to the younger man's nasal voice. He was thickset and ruddy, and came from Alabama.<br><br>"I'll tell thee right smartly, this whole godrotting flyspeck be bad joss!" Brock said. "Joss" was a Chinese word that meant Luck and Fate and God and the Devil combined. "Godrotting bad."<br><br>"It better not be, sir," Tillman said. "The future of the China trade's here now&#x2014;good joss or bad joss."<br><br>Brock stared down at him. "Hong Kong's got no future. It's open ports on the China mainland we be needing, and you knowed it, by God!"<br><br>"The harbor's the best in these waters," Cooper said. "Plenty of room to careen and refit all our ships. Plenty of room to build our homes and warehouses. And no Chinese interference at long last."<br><br>"A colony's got to have arable land and peasants to work the land, Mr. Cooper. An' revenue," Brock said impatiently. "I be walking all over and so have you. Not a crop'll grow here. There be no fields or streams, no grazing land. So no meat and no spuds. Everything we be needing'll have to come by sea. Think of the cost. Why, even the fishing be rotten. An' who's to pay upkeep of Hong Kong, eh? Us and our trade, by God!"<br><br>"Oh, that's the sort of colony you want, Mr. Brock?" Cooper said. "I thought the British Empire"&#x2014;he spat deftly to windward&#x2014;"had enough of that sort of colony."<br><br>Brock's hand strayed near his knife. "Be you spitting to clear yor throat, or spitting on the Empire?" Tyler Brock was nearing fifty, a big, one-eyed man as hard and as permanent as the iron he had been forced to peddle in Liverpool as a youth, and as strong and as dangerous as the fighting merchant ships he had escaped to and at length had come to rule as head of Brock and Sons. His clothes were rich and the knife at his belt was jeweled. His beard was graying like his hair.<br><br>"It's a cold day, Mr. Brock," Tillman said quickly, inwardly angry at his young partner's loose tongue. Brock was no man to bait, and they could not afford open enmity with him yet. "Plenty of chill on the wind, eh, Jeff?"<br><br>Cooper nodded briefly. But he did not take his eyes off Brock. He had no knife, but there was a derringer in his pocket. He was of a height with Brock but slighter, and unafraid.<br><br>"I be givin' thee piece of advice, Mr. Cooper," Brock said. "Best not spit too often after saying 'British Empire.' There be some wot baint be givin' thee benefit of doubt."<br><br>"Thank you, Mr. Brock, I'll remember," Cooper replied easily. "And I'll give you some advice: It's bad joss to curse on a Tuesday."<br><br>Brock suppressed his temper. Eventually he would crush Cooper and Tillman and their company, the biggest of the American traders. But now he needed them as allies against Dirk and Robb Struan. Brock cursed joss. Joss had made Struan and Company the greatest house in Asia, and so rich and powerful that the other China traders had named it in awe and jealousy The Noble House&#x2014;noble because it was first in riches, first in largess, first in trade, first in clippers, but mostly because Dirk Struan was Tai-Pan, the Tai-Pan among all the tai-pans of Asia. And joss had cost Brock an eye seventeen years ago, the year that Struan had founded his empire.<br><br>It had happened off Chushan Island. Chushan was just south of the huge port of Shanghai, near the mouth of the mighty Yangtse River. Brock had beaten up through the monsoon with a huge cargo of opium&#x2014;Dirk Struan a few days astern, also carrying opium. Brock had reached Chushan first, sold his cargo and turned around, knowing happily that now Struan would have to go farther north and try a new coast with fresh risks. Brock had sped south for home&#x2014;Macao&#x2014;his coffers filled with bullion, the full wind astern. Then a great storm had suddenly swooped out of the China seas. The Chinese called these storms tai-fung, the Supreme Winds. The traders called them typhoons. They were terror incarnate.<br><br>The typhoon had battered Brock's ship mercilessly, and he had been pinned by the falling masts and spars. A shorn halyard, caught by the winds, had flailed him as he lay helpless. His men had cut him loose but not before the broken shackle-ended rope had gouged out his left eye. The ship had been on her beam ends and he helped them cut the rigging and spars adrift, and by some miracle she had righted herself. Then he had poured brandy into the bleeding socket; he could still remember the pain.<br><br>And he recalled how he had limped into port long after he had been given up for lost, his fine three-masted clipper no more than a hulk, the seams sprung, masts and guns and rigging gone. And by the time Brock had replaced spars and rigging and masts and cannon and powder and shot and men, and bought another cargo of opium, all the profits of this voyage had vanished.<br><br>Struan had run into the same typhoon in a small lorcha&#x2014;a boat with a Chinese hull, English-rigged and used for coastal smuggling in fine weather. But Struan rode out the storm and, elegant and untouched as usual, had been on the dock to greet Brock, his strange green eyes mocking him.<br><br>Dirk and his cursed joss, Brock thought. Joss be letting Dirk build that one stinking lorcha into a fleet of clippers and hundreds of lorchas, into warehouses and bullion to spare. Into godrotting Noble House. Joss pushed Brock and Sons into godrotting second place. Second. And, he thought, joss's given him ear of our godrotting weak-gutted plenipotentiary, the Honorable Godrotting Longstaff, all these years. An' now, together, they've sold us out. "A&nbsp; pox on Hong Kong and a pox on Struan!"<br>"If it weren't for Struan's plan, you'd never have won your war so easily," Cooper said.<br><br>The war had begun at Canton two years before, when the Chinese emperor, determined to bring the Europeans to heel, tried to eliminate the opium smuggling which was essential to British trade. Viceroy Ling had surrounded the foreign settlement at Canton with troops, and demanded every case of opium in Asia to ransom the lives of the defenseless English traders. At length, twenty thousand cases of opium had been given over and destroyed, and the British were allowed to retreat to Macao. But the British could not take lightly either interference with its trade or threats to its nationals. Six months ago the British Expeditionary Force had arrived in the Orient and ostensibly had been placed under the jurisdiction of Longstaff, the Captain Superintendent of Trade.<br><br>But it was Struan who conceived the inspired plan to by-pass Canton, where all the trouble had started, and instead send the expeditionary force north to Chushan. To take that island without loss would be simple, Struan had theorized, for the Chinese were unprepared and helpless against any modern European army or fleet. Leaving a small holding force at Chushan and a few ships to blockade the Yangtse, the expeditionary force could sail north to the mouth of the Pei Ho River and threaten Peking, the capital of China, which was only a hundred miles upstream. Struan knew that only so direct a threat would make the emperor immediately sue for peace. A superb conception. And it had worked brilliantly. The expeditionary force had arrived in the Orient last June. By July Chushan had been taken. By August it was moored at the Pei Ho. In two weeks the emperor had sent an official to negotiate peace&#x2014;the first time in history that any Chinese emperor had officially acknowledged any European nation. And the war had ended with almost no loss to either side.<br><br>"Longstaff was very wise to follow the plan," Cooper said.<br><br>"Any China trader knowed how to bring the Chinee to their knees," Brock said, his voice rough. He pushed his top hat farther back on his forehead and eased his eye patch. "But why did Longstaff and Struan agree to negotiate back at Canton, eh? Any fool knowed 'negotiate' to a Chinee means to play for time. We should've stayed north at the Pei Ho till peace were signed. But no, we brung back the fleet and for the last six month we be waiting and waiting for the buggers to set pen to paper." Brock spat. "Stupid, crazy stupid. An' all that waste of time and money for this stinking rock. We should've kept Chushan. Now, there be island worth having." Chushan was twenty miles long and ten wide and its land fertile and rich&#x2014;a good port and a big city, Tinghai. "Space for a man to breathe in there, right enough. Why, from there three or four frigates can blockade the Yangtse at the drop of a topper. An' who controls that river controls the heart of China. That's where we should settle, by God."<br><br>"You still have Chushan, Mr. Brock."<br><br>"Yus. But it baint deeded in godrotting treaty, so it baint our'n." He stamped his feet against the growing chill wind.<br><br>"Perhaps you should mention it to Longstaff," Cooper said. "He's susceptible to advice."<br><br>"Not to mine, he baint. As thee rightly knowed. But I'll tell thee, when Parliament hear about the treaty, there be hell to pay, I'll be bound."<br><br>Cooper lit a cheroot. "I'm inclined to agree. It is an astonishing piece of paper, Mr. Brock. For this day and age. When every European power is land-_grabbing and power-hungry."<br><br>"And I suppose the United States baint?" Brock's face tightened. "Wot about yor Indians? The Louisiana Purchase? Spanish Florida? You be havin' eyes on Mexico and Russian Alaska. The last mails told you be even trying to steal Canada. Eh?"<br><br>"Canada's American, not English. We're not going to war over Canada&#x2014;she'll join us of her own free will," Cooper said, hiding his worry. He tugged at his muttonchop whiskers and pulled his frock coat tighter around his shoulders against the sharpening wind. He knew that war with the British Empire would be disastrous at this time, and would ruin Cooper-Tillman. God damn wars. Even so, he knew that the States would have to go to war over Mexico and Canada unless there was a settlement. Just as Britain had had to go to war with China.<br><br>"There won't be a war," Tillman said, trying to quiet Cooper diplomatically. He sighed and wished himself back in Alabama. A man can be a gentleman there, he thought. There you don't have to deal with the damned British every day, or with blasphemous, foulmouthed scum like Brock, or a devil incarnate like Struan&#x2014;or even with an impetuous young man and senior partner like Jefferson Cooper, who thinks Boston the center of the earth. "And this war's over, for better or worse."<br><br>"Mark my words, Mr. Tillman," Brock said. "This godrotting treaty be no good for us'n and no good for they. We've to keep Chushan and open ports on mainland China. We be at war again in a few weeks. In June when the wind be ripe and the weather be ripe, the fleet'll have to sail north to Pei Ho again. An' if we be at war again, how we going to get season's teas and silks, eh? Last year almost no trade because of war&#x2014;the year before no trade at all an' they stole all our opium to boot. Eight thousand cases from me alone. Two million taels of silver that cost me. Cash."<br><br>"That money's not lost," Tillman said. "Longstaff ordered us to give it up. To ransom our lives. He gave us paper on the British Government. And there's a settlement in the treaty. Six million taels of silver to pay for it."<br><br>Brock laughed harshly. "Thee think Parliament be honoring Longstaff's paper? Why, any Government'd be throwed out of office the moment they asked for the brass to pay for opium. An' as to the six million&#x2014;that be paying for the cost of the war. I knowed Parliament better'n you. Kiss yor half million taels goodbye be my advice to you both. So if we be at war again this year, there be no trade again. An' if we baint trading this year, we be all bankrupt. You, me, every China trader. An' even the godrotting Noble House." He jerked out his watch. The ceremony was to have started an hour ago. Time be running out, he thought. Yus, but not on Brock and Sons, by God. Dirk's had seventeen-year run of good joss, and now be time for change.<br><br>Brock reveled in the thought of his second son, Morgan, who capably&#x2014;and ruthlessly&#x2014;controlled all their interests in England. He wondered if Morgan had been successful in undermining Struan's influence in Parliament and in banking circles. We be going to wreck thee, Dirk, he thought, and Hong Kong along with thee. "Wot the hell be the delay for?" he said, hastening toward the naval officer who was striding up and down near the marines.<br><br>"What's the matter with you, Jeff? You know he's right about Hong Kong," Tillman said. "You ought to know better than to bait him."<br><br>Cooper smiled his thin smile. "Brock's so goddam sure of himself. I couldn't help it."<br><br>"If Brock's right about the half million taels, we're ruined."<br><br>"Yes. But Struan will lose ten times that if there's no payment. He'll get paid, never fear. So we'll get ours." Cooper looked after Brock. "Do you think he knows about our deal with Struan?"<br><br>Tillman shrugged. "I don't know. But Brock's right about the treaty. It's stupid. It'll cost us a pretty penny."<br><br>For the last three months Cooper-Tillman had been acting as secret agents for The Noble House. British warships had been blockading Canton and the Pearl River, and British traders were forbidden to trade. Longstaff&#x2014;at Struan's bidding&#x2014;had put the embargo on as another measure to force the peace treaty, knowing that the Canton warehouses were bulging with teas and silks. But since America had not declared war on China, American ships could go through the blockade freely and thumb their noses at the warships. So Cooper-Tillman had bought four million pounds of tea from Chen-tse Jin Arn&#x2014;or Jin-qua, as he was nicknamed&#x2014;the richest of the Chinese merchants, and shipped it to Manila, supposedly for Spanish merchants. The local Spanish official, for a considerable bribe, had issued the necessary import and export licenses, and the tea was transferred&#x2014;duty free&#x2014;into Struan's clippers and rushed to England. Payment to Jin-qua was a shipload of opium delivered secretly by Struan somewhere up the coast.</p><h2>Foe</h2><p>Returning to London after being marooned on an island in the Atlantic, Susan Barton approaches the author Daniel Foe with the story of her adventures with Robinson Cruso and the mute Friday</p><p>J. M. Coetzee was born in Cape Town, South Africa in 1940. The author of some fifteen novels and winner of numerous awards, Coetzee is the first author to have been awarded the Booker Prize twice: for Life &amp; Times of Michael K in 1983 and for Disgrace in 1999. In 2003 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. He lives in Australia.Imaginatively conceived and richly orchestrated, this slim novel by the author of Waiting for the Barbarians is at once a variant of the immortal Robinson Crusoe and a complex parable of art and life. Englishwoman Susan Barton, having been cast away by Portuguese mutineers, reaches the remote island occupied by another castaway named Cruso (sic and his man Friday. She lives on the desolate rocky island for over a year before they are "rescued" by an English ship. Cruso dies en route, and she and Friday are transported to England. The world, she says, demands stories of its adventurers; but how is the story to be told? Indeed, what really happened and what are the facts of her life? What of the mute Friday, sole witness to the events, whose tongue was cut out by marauding slavers? Or did Cruso commit the savage act? In England, she beseeches author Daniel Foe (sic to take the raw material and make a convincing narrative. How does art give life to experience, enliven it, make it vivid, memorable? The truth is sly, evasive; but the novelist closes in upon it with poetic precision to create a small, enigmatic work of art. We are pressed to see in the characters' relationships an allegory of the evil social order that poisons the author's native South Africa. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Card Sharks (Wild Cards: New Cycle, Book 1)</h2><p>Someone is trying to wipe out the jokers--those shadowy behind-the-scenes global players--and they must fight back before they are completely destroyed.

He was<br>fishing on the north shore of Chew Valley Lake, a 1200-acre<br>reservoir at the foot of the Mendip Hills south of Bristol. He<br>had already taken three brown trout of respectable weight.<br><br>He watched keenly for a telltale swirl in the calm lake<br>where he had cast. The conditions were promising. It was an<br>evening late in September, the sky was overcast and the flies<br>in their millions had just whirled above him in their spectacular<br>sunset flight, soaring and swooping over the lake in a<br>mass darker and more dense than the clouds, their droning<br>as resonant as a train in the underground. The day&#x2019;s hatch,<br>irresistible to hungry fish.<br><br>A light south-westerly fretted the surface around him, yet<br>ahead there was this bar of water, known to fishermen as the<br>scum, that showed a different pattern in the fading light.<br>There, he knew by experience, the fish preferred to rise.<br><br>So preoccupied was the man that he failed altogether to<br>notice a pale object at closer proximity. It drifted languidly<br>in the current created by the wind, more than half submerged,<br>with a slight rocking motion that fitfully produced<br>a semblance of life.<br><br>Finally it touched him. A white hand slid against his<br>thigh. A complete arm angled outwards as the body lodged<br>against him, trapped at the armpit. It was a dead woman,<br>face-up and naked.<br><br>The fisherman glanced down. From high in his throat<br>came a childishly shrill, indrawn cry.<br><br>For a moment he stood as if petrified. Then he made an<br>effort to gather himself mentally so as to disentangle himself<br>from the undesired embrace. Unwilling to touch the<br>corpse with his hands, he used the handle of the rod as a<br>lever, lodging the end in the armpit and pushing the body<br>away from him, turning it at the same time, then stepping<br>aside to let it move on its way with the current. That accomplished,<br>he grabbed his net from its anchorage in the mud<br>and, without even stopping to reel in his line, splashed his<br>way to the bank. There, he looked about him. No one was<br>in sight.<br><br>This angler was not public-spirited. His response to the<br>discovery was to bundle his tackle together and move off to<br>his car as fast as possible.<br><br>He did have one judicious thought. Before leaving, he<br>opened the bag containing his catch and threw the three<br>trout back into the water.<br>TWO <br><br>A LITTLE AFTER 10.30 THE same Saturday evening,<br>Police Constable Harry Sedgemoor and his wife Shirley<br>were watching a horror video in their terraced cottage in<br>Bishop Sutton, on the eastern side of the lake. PC Sedgemoor<br>had come off duty at six. His long body was stretched<br>along the length of the sofa, his bare feet projecting over<br>one end. On this hot night he had changed into a black<br>singlet and shorts. A can of Malthouse Bitter was in his left<br>hand, while his right was stroking Shirley&#x2019;s head, idly teasing<br>out the black curls and feeling them spring back into<br>shape. Shirley, after her shower dressed only in her white<br>cotton nightie, reclined on the floor, propped against the<br>sofa. She had her eyes closed. She had lost interest in the<br>film, but she didn&#x2019;t object to Harry watching if it resulted<br>afterwards in his snuggling up close to her in bed, as he<br>usually did after watching a horror film. Secretly, she suspected<br>he was more scared by them than she, but you didn&#x2019;t<br>suggest that sort of thing to your husband, particularly if he<br>happened to be a policeman. So she waited patiently for<br>it to end. The tape hadn&#x2019;t much longer to run. Harry had<br>several times pressed the fast-forward button to get through<br>boring bits of conversation.<br><br>The violins on the video soundtrack were working up to<br>a piercing crescendo when the Sedgemoors both heard the<br>click of their own front gate. Shirley said bitterly, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t<br>believe it! What time is it?&#x2019;<br><br>Her husband sighed, swung his legs off the sofa, got up<br>and looked out of the window. &#x2018;Some woman.&#x2019; He couldn&#x2019;t<br>see much in the porch light.<br><br>He recognized the caller when he opened the door:<br>Miss Trenchard-Smith, who lived alone in one of the older<br>houses at the far end of the village. An upright seventy-yearold<br>never seen without her Tyrolean hat, which over the<br>years had faded in colour from a severe brown to a shade<br>that was starting to fit in with the deep pink of the local<br>stone.<br><br>&#x2018;I hesitate to disturb you so late, Officer,&#x2019; she said as her<br>eyes travelled over his shorts and singlet in a series of rapid<br>jerks. &#x2018;However, I think you will agree that what I have found<br>is sufficiently serious to justify this intrusion.&#x2019; Her gratingly<br>genteel accent articulated the words with self-importance.<br>She may have lived in the village since the war, but she<br>would never pass as local and probably didn&#x2019;t care to.<br>PC Sedgemoor said with indulgence, &#x2018;What might that<br>be, Miss Trenchard-Smith?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A dead body.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A body?&#x2019; He fingered the tip of his chin and tried to<br>appear unperturbed, but his pulses throbbed. After six<br>months in the force he had yet to be called to a corpse.<br><br>Miss Trenchard-Smith continued with her explanation.<br>&#x2018;I was walking my cats by the lake. People don&#x2019;t believe that<br>cats like to be taken for walks, but mine do. Every evening<br>about this time. They insist on it. They won&#x2019;t let me sleep if<br>I haven&#x2019;t taken them out.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A human body, you mean?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, of course. A woman. Not a stitch of clothing on<br>her, poor creature.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;d better show me. Is it . . . is she nearby?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;In the lake, if she hasn&#x2019;t floated away already.&#x2019;<br><br>Sedgemoor refrained from pointing out that the body<br>would remain in the lake even if it had floated away. He<br>needed Miss Trenchard-Smith&#x2019;s co-operation. He invited<br>her into the cottage for a moment while he ran upstairs to<br>collect a sweater and his personal radio.<br><br>Shirley, meanwhile, had stood up and wished a good evening<br>to Miss Trenchard-Smith, whose tone in replying made<br>it plain that in her view no respectable woman ought to be<br>seen in her nightwear outside the bedroom.<br><br>&#x2018;What a horrid experience for you!&#x2019; Shirley remarked,<br>meaning what had happened beside the lake. &#x2018;Would you<br>care for a nip of something to calm you down?&#x2019;<br><br>Miss Trenchard-Smith curtly thanked her and declined.<br>&#x2018;But you can look after my cats while I&#x2019;m gone,&#x2019; she said as<br>if bestowing a favour on Shirley. &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t mind cats, do<br>you?&#x2019; Without pausing to get an answer she went to the door<br>and called, &#x2018;Come on, come on, come on,&#x2019; and two Siamese<br>raced from the shadows straight into the cottage and leapt<br>on to the warm spot Harry had vacated on the sofa as if it<br>were prearranged.<br><br>When Harry came down again, Shirley glanced at what<br>he was wearing and said, &#x2018;I thought you were going upstairs<br>to put some trousers on.&#x2019;<br><br>He said, &#x2018;I might have to wade in and fetch something<br>out, mightn&#x2019;t I?&#x2019;<br><br>She shuddered.<br><br>He picked his torch off the shelf by the door. Managing<br>to sound quite well in control, he said, &#x201c;Bye, love.&#x2019; He<br>kissed Shirley lightly and tried to provide more reassurance<br>by whispering, &#x2018;I expect she imagined it.&#x2019;<br><br>Not that tough old bird, Shirley thought. If she says she<br>found a corpse, it&#x2019;s there.<br><br>Harry Sedgemoor was less certain. While driving Miss<br>Trenchard-Smith the half-mile or so down to the lakeside<br>he seriously speculated that she might be doing this out<br>of a desire to enliven her placid routine with gratuitous<br>excitement. Old women living alone had been known to<br>waste police time with tall stories. If this were the case he<br>would be incensed. He was damned sure Shirley wouldn&#x2019;t<br>want to make love after this. Whatever there might or<br>might not be in the lake, the mention of a corpse would<br>colour her imagination so vividly that nothing he did or<br>said would relax her.<br><br>With an effort to be the policeman, he asked Miss<br>Trenchard-Smith to tell him where to stop the car.<br><br>&#x2018;Anywhere you like,&#x2019; she said with an ominously nonchalant<br>air. &#x2018;I haven&#x2019;t the faintest idea where we are.&#x2019;<br><br>He halted where the road came to an end. They got out<br>and started across a patch of turf, his torch probing the<br>space ahead.

Written by leading experts, these individual studies explore the richness and variety of important religions from around the world.</p><p><p>The Zulu andTheir Religious Tradition</p><p><b>The Origins of the Zulu People</b></p><p>The origins of the Zuli people are shrouded in the mists of oral tradition. But by using a variety of specialized methods, scholars have been able to penetrate the mists and discover some of the Zulu past. They have concluded that within the last two thousand years there have been a series of migrations of large numbers of people from central Africa into the southern part of the continent. These migrants from the north had a linguistic identity, and they are referred to as Bantu-speaking peoples. This means that although these people spoke many different languages the languages were similar enough in form and structure to deserve a common name, Bantu. Scholars chose the name Bantu because this word, meaning "people;' occurs in a large array of languages spoken by the migrants. These people slowly settled the southeastern area of Africa all the way down to what is now known as the province of Natal in the Republic of South Africa. As they settled the land they began to form special groups. One large group is now known as the Nguni people. The Nguni group consisted of many tribes and clans: the Xhosa, the Fingo, the Tembu, the Pondo, the Swazi, and the Zulu. This process of migration and solidification into special groups, each with a distinct language, was complete by the seventeenth century.</p><p>The Zulu at this stage of development were one group of people among many. According to their own traditions, an ancestor named Malandela had two sons named Qwabe and Zulu. These two sons became the chiefs of two clans. Chief Zulu extended his quest for territory until he came to the Mfolosi Valley, an area north of the Thukela River in the present-day province of Natal. There Chief Zulu settled. His clan remained stable and unremarkable until the renowned Zulu chief <b>Shaka </b>(1787-1828) emerged as a dynamic leader and warrior at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Shaka in a very short time welded many different clans together into one powerful kingdom. He was successful in this endeavor because he developed completely new methods of military conquest, establishing highly disciplined regiments of young men and inventing new ways of deploying them in battle. It is Shaka's prowess as a general that has captivated the imagination of Western novelists and filmmakers. Movies about the Zulu warrior continue to be made to this day.</p><p>Today there are about four million Zulu in South Africa. They continue tolive primarily on a small portion of their original land in the northeast sectionof Natal. However, many Zulu can also be found throughout South Africa work-ing in the mines, as domestic servants, and in those positions in the world ofindustry and business not reserved for whites (although this picture is now inthe process of change). Even under such very difficult conditions some Zuluhave been able to attain a high level of education and thus will be found eitherat the segregated universities provided by the South African government or, inspecial cases, at one of the English-speaking universities, such as the Universityof Cape Thwn or Rhodes University. (Recently the picture has changed andpredominantly white universities, including Afrikaans-speaking universities,have a more open admissions policy.)</p><p>When the government of South Africa declared a portion of the province ofNatal as the Zulu "homeland;" they named it Kwazulu. Supposedly, within thisarea the Zulu would finally have some political rights. Whether or not thisoccurs, this greatly diminished area has not proved to be self-sufficient. TheZulu therefore have been forced to continue their dependence on white SouthAfrica, with its system of <b>apartheid</b>. Apartheid is a governmental policyintended to keep the various groups of people living in South Africa separatefrom each other. Its practical effect has been to keep all black people in aposition of servitude, without political rights of any kind. The "homeland" is certainly far less in area than the traditional Zulu kingdom. At this moment the Zulu are strongly insisting through two different organizations, the African National Congress and the Inkatha party, on their autonomy and freedom. Zulu leaders have often been some of the most eloquent spokesmen for the rights of all black people in South Africa. In fact, the Zulu chief <b>Albert Luthuli </b>was granted the Nobel Peace Prize in 1960 (the first African to be so honored) for his articulate and peaceful presentation of the case for all the oppressed people of South Africa.</p><p>While the Zulu people continue in such an oppressed situation it remains impossible to speak of an independent kingdom or nation, despite their possession of the small territory, Kwazulu. Long before this possession, the buffeting that these people had received from both British and Boer had already destroyed their autonomy.</p><p>In 1879 the British invaded the Zulu kingdom established by Shaka and maintained by the succeeding chiefs. Cetshwayo was the last of the Zulu kings or great chiefs. After the British invasion of Zululand he was exiled; the invasion and his exile signaled the end of Zulu territorial and political independence. In 1897 Zululand was ceded to the British colony of Natal. Shortly after this cession, the British and the <b>Afrikaaners </b>engaged in a war disastrous for both. This war created a deep enmity between the two white groups. In 1910 the Union of South Africa was formed as a state within the British Commonwealth. In 1913 the South African government promulgated the Native Land Act, naming a portion of traditional Zululand as a "native reserve" In fact, by 1906 much of the territory that the Zulu regarded as their own kingdom had already been overrun and was possessed by white Natal settlers of both British and Boer stock. It is the remnants of this native reserve that has now been designated as Kwazulu, the "homeland" of the Zulu people.</p></p><h2>Marven of the Great North Woods</h2><p>When the great influenza epidemic strikes Duluth, Minnesota, in 1918, Marven&#x2019;s parents know they must send their son far away to keep him safe from the disease. So the ten-year-old boards a train headed for a logging camp, not knowing if he will ever see his family again. In the great north woods, Marven finds a new world of towering trees, endless expanses of snow, and lumberjacks as big as grizzly bears. He feels very alone among the enormous woodsmen--until he meets Jean-Louis, the burliest jack of all, and they become fast friends.<br></p><p><br>KATHRYN LASKY's many books for young people have received such honors as the Parents' Choice Award, the National Jewish Book Award, and a Newbery Honor citation.

She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. &lt;br&gt;www.xensei.com/users/newfilm/homelsk.htm<br>^No BioGrade 1-3?Children often enjoy reading about a young person who can competently handle a great adventure without parental supervision, and this boy does just that. Marven, 10, is sent to a remote lumber camp to escape a 1918 influenza epidemic in his hometown of Duluth, MN. He takes the train by himself and skis the five miles from the station to the camp. He is assigned to keep the books for the lumber camp and quickly devises an effective system. Although he longs to be reunited with his close-knit family, he makes friends with the French-speaking lumberjacks and finds a way to adapt his Jewish dietary laws to the camp food. The story becomes even more enjoyable when readers learn that it is based on an actual event. A concluding note includes photographs of Marven and relates that the man, now in his 90s, still has a good head for math. Hawkes's acrylic paintings are especially effective in showing the small boy against the vast Minnesota landscape and in comparison to the brawny lumberjacks.

Reflections on Justice and Nationhood</h2><p>This book offers chapters written by Chomsky just before the 2000 Intifada and up through October 2002, when 9-11 and a prospective military campaign against Iraq add new pressures to age-old conflicts.</p><p>Noam Chomsky, author of more than 80 books, is a professor in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He speaks regularly to audiences in the United States and throughout the world. The New York Times has described him as &#39;an exploder of received truths.&#39;Chomsky's scathing indictments of U.S. foreign policy have long divided readers, and this collection of essays about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is likely to do the same. Written during the last 30 years, these pieces display many characteristics of Chomsky's thought: a deep mistrust of U.S. and Israeli intentions and a desire to change the course of history. Chomsky is erudite, and some of the points are now standard in discussion about the Middle East, such as the contradiction of Israel being both a Jewish state and a democracy. But Chomsky reprints numerous dated talks-and some of these, while interesting historical relics, contain statements that haven't stood the test of time, such as a 1969 observation that "both international and domestic factors are more conducive to a peaceful resolution of the conflict than has been the case for some time." More recent pieces attack the Oslo peace process, which he sees as "neocolonialist" and resembling South African apartheid. Chomsky's alternative-a binational state-seems highly unlikely given the violence of the past few years. This book is also intriguing for what it omits: in his historical roundup, for instance, Chomsky fails to mention violent Arab riots against Jews before Israel's founding in 1948. For some leftist critics of the U.S. and Israel, this book will ring true. But for many readers-perhaps even some who read Chomsky's bestselling 9-11-it will seem one-sided. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Baseball Anecdotes</h2><p>In the 150 years since its humble birth, baseball has shown an infinite capacity for exhilarating triumphs, heart-breaking losses, amusing blunders, and awe-inspiring feats. Willie Mays's amazing catch of Vic Wertz's monstrous drive in the 1954 World Series, Bobby Thomson's "shot heard round the world," the "Black Sox" Scandal of 1919, DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak, even the pitiful 1962 Mets, who finished 60 games (or two full months) out of first place--these are all part of baseball lore and part of its allure. <br> A banquet for baseball fans, <em>Baseball Anecdotes</em> offers a colorful and highly entertaining anecdotal history of America's National Pastime, from the founding of the first professional baseball team, Cincinnati's Red Stockings, by George Wright (the son of a famous English cricketer) and the forming of the first league (in a New York bar on St. Patrick's Day), to the miraculous comeback of the Mets in the Sixth Game of the 1986 World Series. Here you will meet the game's great innovators (from John Montgomery Ward, who invented the pitching mound--and also pitched the second perfect game in history--to Bill Veeck, who introduced the exploding scoreboard in Comiskey Park); the colorful eccentrics (such as King Kelly, who was accompanied off the field by a black monkey and a Japanese valet) and the self-effacing stars (such as Harmon Killebrew, who, when asked what his hobbies were, said, "Well, I like to wash dishes"); the penny-pinching owners (when Babe Ruth requested tickets for the Yankee's 1936 season opener at The House That Ruth Built, the team management said sure, just send in a check); and, most of all, the legendary players: Ruth, Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, Lefty Gomez, Sandy Koufax, Casey Stengel, Mickey Mantle, and countless others. Along the way, readers are treated to instant replays of some of baseball's most memorable moments, such as Roger Maris' quest for Ruth's 61-home-run record, Don Larsen's perfect World Series game, and Ted Williams' final major league at bat (he hit a home run). <br> Okrent and Wulf, two highly regarded baseball writers, touch all the bases in this vividly written volume, capturing the whole human drama of baseball in a cascade of stories that offers a nostalgic feast (or, as Yogi Berra would put it, "Deja vu all over again") as well as a fascinating introduction to baseball lore for the newest generation of fans.</p><p><br><strong>Daniel Okrent</strong> is Editor of <em>New England Monthly</em>, the author of <em>Nine Innings</em>, and co-author of <em>The Ultimate Baseball Book</em> (with Harris Lewine). <strong>Steve Wulf</strong> is a senior editor with <em>Sports Illustrated</em>.<br>This history of baseball in anecdotal form contains many familiar stories, but many more that will be new to fans. Okrent ( The Ultimate Baseball Book ; Nine Innings ) and Wulf, senior editor for baseball at Sports Illustrated , recount such tales as Fred Merkle's failure to touch second base in 1908, Babe Ruth's alleged calling of the spot where he would hit a home run and the time three Brooklyn Dodgers all wound up on the same base. There are off-diamond gems, too, including accounts of catcher Moe Berg's avocation as a spy, manager Casey Stengel's testimony before a congressional subcommittee on antitrust that left the senators completely baffled, and Dizzy Dean's reply to critics of his English: "A lot of guys that ain't sayin' ain't, ain't eatin'."

Since its publication, the trends he identified have proceeded faster than anyone could have anticipated. The 2008 financial crisis turned the world upside down, stalling the United States and other advanced economies. Meanwhile emerging markets have surged ahead, coupling their economic growth with pride, nationalism, and a determination to shape their own future.<br><br> In this new edition, Zakaria makes sense of this rapidly changing landscape. With his customary lucidity, insight, and imagination, he draws on lessons from the two great power shifts of the past 500 years&#x2015;the rise of the Western world and the rise of the United States&#x2015;to tell us what we can expect from the third shift, the &#x201c;rise of the rest.&#x201d; The great challenge for Britain was economic decline. The challenge for America now is political decline, for as others have grown in importance, the central role of the United States, especially in the ascendant emerging markets, has already begun to shrink. As Zakaria eloquently argues, Washington needs to begin a serious transformation of its global strategy, moving from its traditional role of dominating hegemon to that of a more pragmatic, honest broker. It must seek to share power, create coalitions, build legitimacy, and define the global agenda&#x2015;all formidable tasks.<br><br> None of this will be easy for the greatest power the world has ever known&#x2015;the only power that for so long has really mattered. America stands at a crossroads: In a new global era where the United States no longer dominates the worldwide economy, orchestrates geopolitics, or overwhelms cultures, can the nation continue to thrive?</p><p><p></p><strong> Fareed Zakaria and Ian Bremmer: Author One-to-One</strong><strong> </strong> <br>In this Amazon exclusive, we brought together authors Fareed Zakaria and Ian Bremmer and asked them to interview each other.<p></p> <p>Ian Bremmer is the president of Eurasia Group, the world's leading global political risk research and consulting firm. He has written for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, and other publications, and his books include <em>Every Nation for Itself</em>, <em>The End of the Free Market</em>, and <em>The J Curve</em>. Read on to see Ian Bremmer's questions for Fareed Zakaria, or turn the tables to see what Zakaria asked Bremmer.</p> <p><strong>Ian Bremmer:</strong> You made clear from the opening sentence of <i>The Post-American World</i> that you do not believe that America faces some kind of inevitable, irreversible decline. But how can U.S. policymakers ensure that the rise of the rest actually strengthens the United States? </p> <p><strong>Fareed Zakaria:</strong> If more countries thrive in the existing global system, it means a larger world economy--more consumers and producers, investors and inventors. That&#x2019;s great for America. As Europe boomed after World War II, America boomed with it. The rise of Japan and Korea and Taiwan has not meant the decline of America. But the key has been that we have to be able to adjust and adapt. The US economy was enormously productive in the 1950s and 1960s--leading the world in almost every way, from technology to infrastructure to mass education. Our problem is that we no longer lead the world on many of these dimensions-- think of infrastructure or K-12 education--and the rest of the world has been hard at work catching up. So, the fault lies not in our competitors but in ourselves. The good news is, if we can rectify these mistakes, we should still do well in the emerging world. </p> <p><strong>Bremmer:</strong> Given everything that has happened since 2008--the financial market meltdown, the Eurozone crisis, the Arab Spring--have you become more confident or less that the United States can successfully transition from its previous role as global hegemon to a new role as the most powerful among other powerful countries? </p> <p><strong>Zakaria:</strong> There are two distinct (though related) challenges for Washington in a Post-American World. The first is economic, which I outline above. The second is political. Here the structural challenge might seem daunting. Political power is not like economic power. In economics, others can grow and that can be good for you--win, win. In politics, power is relative. As China and India and Brazil and Turkey all prosper and gain strength and confidence, whose dominant influence are they cutting into? The U.S. But even here, the picture is actually quite hopeful for America. The truth is, only America has power along all dimensions &#x2013; economic, military, political, cultural. And that gives it great strength, particularly as an agenda-setter. Also, the rise of these other countries creates uncertainty and anxiety in the international system. If the United States plays its cards well, it can be the crucial stabilizing force in the system. You can see that dynamic at work in Asia where China&#x2019;s rise has unsettled many Asian countries and they look to America to play a stabilizing role. It&#x2019;s a new diplomatic challenge for America, to be more of a catalyst and broker than hegemon and arbiter. It emphasizes brains more than brawn. Let&#x2019;s hope we&#x2019;re up to it. </p> <p><strong>Bremmer:</strong> How can policymakers overcome the polarization of American politics to get this right? </p> <p><strong>Zakaria:</strong> That&#x2019;s the trillion-dollar question. America&#x2019;s economy and society remain dynamic. It&#x2019;s political system is broken. First, recognize the problem. Stop mouthing slogans about how we have the world&#x2019;s greatest democracy. Our system is now highly dysfunctional and corrupt. We need to fix it. </p> <p><strong>Bremmer:</strong> Among rising states, which do you think have the most staying power and why? Will some of the rest be left behind? </p> <p><strong>Zakaria:</strong> China is in a league apart from every other rising power. It has the scale--in terms of sheer numbers--to have a huge global impact. It is also run by a competent elite, technocrats who plan for the long term and are moving China up the value chain. They are making huge investments in education and infrastructure, which will pay off over the long run. I agree with you that China continues to have a long-term political challenge, how to combine a vigorous and open economy with a closed and bureaucratic political system. But so far they have managed to balance it--I think they will need to make much larger political changes in the next decade than they have in the last decade. </p> <p><strong>Bremmer:</strong> How well do you think America is responding to China&#x2019;s continued rise? </p> <p><strong>Zakaria:</strong> American business has been responding well to China&#x2019;s rise, helping it but also benefitting from it. American society is more closed and parochial than American business and so there has been little contact, which is a pity because we can always learn from others. Washington, at a foreign policy level, has actually done quite well in its handling of China. It has encouraged the integration of China into the global economy, it has tried to get China to be more rule-based and more committed to producing (rather than consuming) global public goods. And it has carefully and systematically shored up its alliances with key Asian countries, from India to Japan to South Korea to Australia, which is an important hedge against Chinese expansion. All in all, a solid performance. </p> <p><strong>Bremmer:</strong> You devote a chapter to India&#x2019;s growing prominence. Are you optimistic that India&#x2019;s government will help spur the country toward the next stage of its economic development? Or is this still a country where progress will come mainly in spite of government? </p> <p><strong>Zakaria:</strong> China grows because of its government, and India grows in spite of its government. I don&#x2019;t expect much improvement in India&#x2019;s public policy. The infrastructure will continue to lag, the education system will be poor, the government will keep doling out subsidies, and tax and regulatory policy will be uncompetitive. But Indian businesses are world class. They manage under very difficult conditions to perform amazingly well. They manage capital efficiently, understand global markets and brands, and have high quality management. India has good demographics, with lots of young consumers. India&#x2019;s story is a bottom-up story, rather than China&#x2019;s top-down story. But don&#x2019;t kid yourself. Ultimately, you need good government policy to go to the next stage. Unless there is massive and intelligent investment in human and physical capital, India will lag behind China substantially. Whether in India or America, bad government will be a huge limiting factor on a country&#x2019;s success, no matter how dynamic the society and the economy. </p> Photo of Ian Bremmer � Marc Bryan BrownThe Post-American World: Release 2.0 <p> Ian Bremmer- You made clear from the opening sentence of The Post-American World that you do not believe that America faces some kind of inevitable, irreversible decline.

They manage capital efficiently, understand global markets and brands, and have high quality management. India has good demographics, with lots of young consumers. India&#x2019;s story is a bottom-up story, rather than China&#x2019;s top-down story. But don&#x2019;t kid yourself. Ultimately, you need good government policy to go to the next stage. Unless there is massive and intelligent investment in human and physical capital, India will lag behind China substantially. Whether in India or America, bad government will be a huge limiting factor on a country&#x2019;s success, no matter how dynamic the society and the economy.</p></p><h2>A Winter in Arabia: A Journey Through Yemen</h2><p>A Winter in Arabia recounts her 1937-8 expedition in what is now Yemen, a journey which helped secure her reputation not only as a great travel writer, but also as a first-rate geographer, historian, and archaeologist.

His ear tufts were up and glowing scarlet. The frills around his neck were like spikes of steel. There was anger anger and passion in his gaze, a look that said trespassers were not welcom. David took a deep breath. He had nothing but his honesty with which to shield himself now. He stepped forward, out of the shadows.</i></p><p> <i>He braced himself for a burst of fire, but it did not happen. A subtle change occurred in the firebird's expression. It tipped its beak forward and brought its eyes more central to its head. Those eyes grew very round indeed and blinked several times before settling to a stare. Whatever mechanism governed the way they took in light extended to its maximum, making the eyeballs shine like mirrors-until David could see himself reflected in them, playing back like a pin-size movie.</i></p></p><h2>Just Call Me Mike: A Journey to Actor and Activist</h2><p><br>From its opening pages, Mike Farrell&#x2019;s new memoir reveals the distinctive voice of a man for whom life is an ongoing odyssey of self-discovery, personal commitment, and uncompromising social engagement.<br>With deep insight and disarming candor, Farrell describes his early years as a timid but restless teenager in West Hollywood, delivering groceries to the homes of Jack Benny, Lucille Ball, Jimmy Stewart, and countless other celebrities, while dreaming of having his own career as an actor.

Frank and Marina Drummer went on the road in 2002, they set out to visit as many people from different California tribes as possible. Crisscrossing the state, they taped hundreds of hours of interviews and collected copies of nearly fifteen hundred family photos. The documentary project, funded by the California State Library and LEF Foundation, paints an unprecedented portrait of California&#x2019;s indigenous people using their own words and photographs from their own family albums. In turns moody, beautiful, warm, and humorous, <i>First Families</i> is a one-of-a-kind book that combines extremely personal images with text that gives readers a broader, deeper view of Indian history and many complex living cultures.</p><p>L. Frank (Ajachmem/Tongva) is an artist and ''decolonizationist'' who has exhibited in numerous shows and published a collection of her drawings, <i>Acorn Soup</i>. A cultural activist, she is one of the founding board members of the Advocates for Indigenous California Language Survival.<p>Kim Hogeland has an M.A. in history from U.C. Davis and is a regular contributor for <i>News from Native California</i>. She lives in Oakland and works as a freelance writer and historian.</p>This extraordinary book presents California Indians from across the state, using their own family photographs and stories. Frank and Hogeland traveled the state talking with people about their lives and collecting photographs chosen and described by individuals. The resulting book, full of remarkable photographs spanning more than a century, presents California&#39;s Indians as they see themselves. Included here are photographs of daily family life, formal portraits, soldiers off to war, young women in dresses and heels, men and women working on traditional arts or dressed in ceremonial regalia, and much more. Taken together, these photographs illustrate the rich and multidimensional life of California Indians and serve as a fine contrast to the more formal, staged, and representative photos with which many readers may be familiar. The accompanying text--introductory chapters, stories highlighting a specific photo or group of photos, and personal reminiscences of the individuals who shared their photographs--are engaging, conversational, and often sparkling with subtle humor. The entire effect is one of sharing someone&#39;s personal photo album and family stories. At once familiar and informative, this is a remarkable book. Summing Up: Highly recommended.

It was September, but out on the prairie, the heat still held a mid-summer ferocity.</p><p>I tried the gate in the cyclone fence, but it was heavily padlocked; when I pushed hard to see if it would open enough for me to slide through, the metal burned my fingers. A camera and a microphone were mounted on top of the gatepost, but both had been shot out.</p><p>I backed away and looked around the empty landscape. Mine had been the only car on the gravel county road as I bumped my way down from the turnoff in Palfry. Except for the crows circling and diving into the brown cornstalks across the road, I was completely alone. I felt tiny and vulnerable under the blue bowl of the sky. It closed over the earth in all directions, seeming to shut out air, to let in nothing but light and heat.</p><p>Despite dark glasses and a visored cap, my eyes throbbed from the glare. As I walked around the house, looking for a break in the fence, purple smoke rings danced in front of me.</p><p>The house was old and falling down. Glass had broken out, or been shot out, of most of the windows. Someone had nailed slabs of plywood over them, but hadn&#x2019;t put much effort into the job: in several places the wood swung free, secured by only a couple of nails. Behind the plywood, someone had stuffed pieces of cardboard or tatty cloth around the broken panes.</p><p>The steel fence had revolving spikes on top to discourage trespassers like me. Signs warned of guard dogs, but I didn&#x2019;t hear any barking or snuffling as I walked the perimeter.</p><p>In front, the house was close to the fence and to the road, but in the back the fence enclosed a large stretch of land. An old shed had collapsed in one corner. A giant pit, filled with refuse and stinking of chemicals, had been dug near the shed. Jugs, spray cans of solvent, and all the other fixings of a meth operation fought with coffee grounds and chicken bones for top stench.</p><p>It was behind the shed that I found the opening I needed. Someone had been before me with heavy steel cutters, taking out a piece of fence wide enough for a car to drive through. The cuts were recent, the steel along the pointed ends shiny, unlike the dull gray of the rest of the metal. As I passed between the cuts, the skin on my neck prickled with something more than heat. I wished I&#x2019;d brought my gun with me, but I hadn&#x2019;t known I was coming to a drug house when I left Chicago.</p><p>Whoever cut the fence had dealt with the back door in a similarly economic way, kicking it in so that it hung on one hinge. The smell that rolled out the open door&#x2014;metallic, like iron, mixed with rotting meat&#x2014;was all too easy to recognize.. I pulled my shirt up over my nose and looked cautiously inside. A dog lay just beyond the doorway, his chest blown open. Some large-caliber something had taken him down as he tried to protect the losers he lived with.</p><p>&#x201c;Poor old Rottweiler, your mama never meant you to guard a drug house, did she?&#x201d; I whispered. &#x201c;Not your fault, boy, wrong place, wrong time, wrong people.&#x201d;</p><p>Flies were busy in his wounds; the ends of his ribs were already exposed, patches of white beneath the black of dried blood and muscle. Insects had eaten out his eyes. I felt my lunch start to rise up and made it down the steps in time to throw up in the pit by the shed.</p><p>I went back to my car on wobbly legs and collapsed on the front seat. I drank some water from the bottle I&#x2019;d brought with me. It was as hot as the air and tasted rubbery, but it settled my stomach a bit. I sat for some minutes watching a farmer move up and down a remote field, dust billowing around him. He was too far away for me to hear; the only sound came from the wind in the corn, and the crows circling above it.</p><p>When my legs and stomach calmed down, I took the big beach towel I use for my dogs from the backseat. In the trunk I found an old T-shirt that I slit open so I could tie it over my nose and mouth. Armed with this makeshift mask, I returned to the house. I waved the towel hard enough to dislodge most of the flies, then covered the dog.</p><p>When I stepped over his body, it was into a kitchen from hell. A scarred wooden hutch, once painted white, was filled with spray cans of starter fluid, drain cleaner, jars part-full of ugly-looking liquids, eye droppers, Vicks inhalers, and gallon jugs labeled &#x201c;muriatic acid.&#x201d; A makeshift lab hood with an exhaust vent had been constructed over the hutch. Half-buried in the filth were a number of industrial face masks.</p><p>Whoever had kicked in the door had also pulled linoleum from the floor and pried up some of the rotting boards underneath. I squatted and pointed my flashlight through an opening between the exposed joists. Water heater, furnace, stood on the dirt floor below me, but no bodies as far as I could tell. Cool air rose from the basement, along with a smell of leaf mold that seemed wholesome in contrast to the chemicals around me.</p><p>I straightened and played my light around the room. It was hard to tell how much of the shambles had been caused by the dog killers and how much by the natives.</p><p>I stepped over jugs that had been knocked to the floor, skirted a couple of plug-in heaters, and moved into the rooms beyond.</p><p>It was an old farmhouse, with a front room that had once been a formal parlor, judging by the remnants of decorative tiles around the empty fireplace. These had been pried out of the mantel and shattered. Someone had held target practice against an old rolltop desk. An angry hand had smashed the drawers and scattered papers around the floor.</p><p>I stooped to look at them. Most were past-due notices from the county for taxes and for garbage pickup. The Palfry Public Library wanted a copy of Gone With the Wind that Agnes Schlafly had checked out in 1979.</p><p>Scraps of photos were all that remained of a savagely mangled album. When I dropped it back on the scrap heap, it dislodged one intact picture. It was an old photo, bleached and scarred from its time in the meth house, which showed a dozen or so people gathered around a large metal egg balanced on a giant tripod. It looked like a cartoon version of a pod landing from outer space, but the group around it looked at the camera with solemn pride. Three women, in the longer skirts and thick-heeled shoes of the 1930s, sat in the middle; five men stood behind them, all in jackets and ties.</p><p>I frowned over it, wondering what the metal egg could possibly be. Pipes ran through it; perhaps it was the prototype of a machine to ferry milk from cow to refrigerated storage. Just because it was an oddity, I stuck it into my bag.</p><p>The adjacent room contained a couple of card tables and some chairs with broken backs. Empty pizza cartons, chicken bones, and a bowl of cereal that was growing mold: I could see it as a Bosch still life.</p><p>A staircase led to a second floor; tucked underneath it was a stopped-up toilet. A better detective than I might have looked inside, but the smell told me more than I wanted to know.</p><p>Three bedrooms were built under the eaves at the top of the stairs. Two of them held only mattresses and plastic baskets. These had been upended, spilling dirty clothes over the floor. The mattresses had been slit, so that hunks of batting covered the clothes.</p><p>There&#x2019;d been an actual bed and a dresser in the third bedroom, but these, too, had been ripped apart. An eight-by-ten of a young woman holding a baby had been torn from the frame, which itself had been broken in half and tossed onto the shredded bedclothes.</p><p>I picked up the photo, cautiously, by the edges. The print was so faded that I couldn&#x2019;t make out the woman&#x2019;s face, but she had a halo of dark curls. I slipped the picture into my shoulder bag along with the one of the milk pod.</p><p>A large poster of Judy Garland, with the caption Somewhere Over The Rainbow, hung by one corner over the bedstead, the tape ripped away from the other edges. I wondered if that was the drug user&#x2019;s joke: &#x201c;way up high.&#x201d; It was hard to imagine a meth addict as a purveyor of irony, but it&#x2019;s easy to be judgmental about people you&#x2019;ve never met.</p><p>The few clothes in the closet&#x2014;a gold evening gown, a velvet jacket that had once been maroon, and a pair of designer jeans&#x2014;had also been slit.</p><p>&#x201c;You got somebody pretty pissed off, didn&#x2019;t you,&#x201d; I murmured to whoever wore those clothes. My voice sounded odd in the dismembered room.</p><p>If there&#x2019;d been anything to find in this ruined house, the dog&#x2019;s killers already had it. In my days with the public defender&#x2019;s office, I used to see this kind of destruction with depressing frequency.</p><p>Most likely the invaders had been hunting for more drugs. Or they felt the drug dealers had done them out of something. The addicts I&#x2019;d known would have traded their mother&#x2019;s wedding ring for a single hit and then come back to shoot up the place so they could retrieve their jewelry. I&#x2019;d represented one woman who killed her own son when he couldn&#x2019;t get back the ring he&#x2019;d traded for a rock of crack.</p><p>I climbed down the steep stairs and found the door that led to the basement. I walked partway down the stairs, but a spider the size of my hand scuttling from my flashlight kept me from descending all the way. I shone my flash around but didn&#x2019;t see signs of blood or battle.</p><p>I left through the front door so that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to wade through the kitchen again. The door had a series of dead bolts, as unnecessary an investment as the security camera over the padlocked gate. Whoever had been here before me had shot them out.</p><p>Before retreating through the gap in the fence, I found a board in the high weeds and used it to poke through the open pit. It held so many empty bottles that I didn&#x2019;t want to climb down in it, but as far as I could tell, no one was hidden among them.</p><p>I took a few pictures with my camera phone and headed for the exit. I was just skirting the fence, heading to the road, when I heard a faint whimpering from the collapsed shed. I pushed my way through weeds and rubble and pulled apart the siding. Another Rottweiler lay there. When it saw me, it feebly thumped its stub of a tail.</p><p>I bent slowly. It made no effort to attack me as I cautiously felt its body. A female, painfully thin, but uninjured as far as I could tell. She&#x2019;d gotten tangled in a mass of old ropes and fence wires. She&#x2019;d fled into the shed when her partner was murdered, I was guessing, then panicked and worked herself deep into the makeshift net. I slowly pried the wires away from her chest and legs.</p><p>When I moved away and squatted, hand held out, she got to her feet to follow me, but collapsed again after a few steps. I went back to my car for my water bottle and a rope. I poured a little water over her head, cupped my hand so she could drink, tied the rope around her neck. Once she was rehydrated, she let me lead her slowly along the fence to the road. Out in the daylight, I could see the cuts from where the wires had dug into her, but also welts in her dirty black fur. Some vermin had beaten her, and more than once.</p><p>When we reached my car, she wouldn&#x2019;t get in. I tried to lift her, but she growled at me, bracing her weak legs in the weeds along the verge, straining against the rope to get out into the road. I dropped the rope and watched as she staggered across the gravel. At the cornfield, she sniffed among the stalks until she found what she was looking for.

Drawing on insights from zoology, theology, cultural studies and aesthetics, an international line-up of contributors explore such topics as our origins as reflected in early cave art in the upper Palaeolithic through to our prospects at the forefront of contemporary biotechnology. In the process, the book positions &#34;the human&#34; in readiness for what many have characterized as our transhuman or posthuman future. For if our status as rational animals or &#34;animals that think&#34; has traditionally distinguished us as apparently superior to other species, this distinction has become increasingly problematic. It has come to be seen as based on skills and technologies that do not distinguish us so much as position us as transitional animals. It is the direction and consequences of this transition that is the central concern of Beyond Human.</p><p>Explores the implications of our animal origins and posthuman futures for our understanding of our humanity and our relations with other species.<p>Claire<br>Molloy is Senior Lecturer in the School of Politics, History, Media &amp; Communication at Liverpool Hope University, UK and a Fellow of the Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics.<br>She has published on anthropomorphism, representations of animals in<br>videogames and literature and dangerous<br>dogs, media and risk.

Written as a result of the author&#39;s Greek travels and studies, Cassandra speaks to us in a pressing monologue whose inner focal points are patriarchy and war. In the four accompanying pieces, which take the form of travel reports, journal entries, and a letter, Wolf describes the novel&#39;s genesis. Incisive and intelligent, the entire volume represents an urgent call to examine the past in order to insure a future.</p><p>In 1980 East German author <b>Christa Wolf</b> took a trip to Greece accompanied by her husband, Gerhard. In 1982 she was awarded a guest lectureship at the University of Frankfurt, where in May she delivered a series of five "Lectures on Poetics" relating to her Greek travels and studies. The fifth "lecture" was ad raft of the novel <i>Cassandra</i>, which she then revised and expanded for publication. The four introductory lectures were published separately in Germany under the title <i>Conditions of a Narrative: Cassandra; The Frankfurt Lectures on Poetics </i>(<i>Voraussetzungen einer Erz�hlung: Kassandra</i>).

The play holds the stage and its characters hammer home, strongly, the notion of newfound freedom.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michael Phillips, <i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p><i>Gem of the Ocean</i> is the play that begins it all. Set in 1904 Pittsburgh, it is chronologically the first work in August Wilson&#x2019;s decade-by-decade cycle dramatizing the African American experience during the 20th century&#x2014;an unprecedented series that includes the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning plays <i>Fences</i> and <i>The Piano Lesson</i>. Aunt Esther, the drama&#x2019;s 287-year-old fiery matriarch, welcomes into her Hill District home Solly Two Kings, who was born into slavery and scouted for the Union Army, and Citizen Barlow, a young man from Alabama searching for a new life. <i>Gem of the Ocean</i> recently played across the country and on Broadway, with Phylicia Rashad as Aunt Esther.</p><p>Earlier in 2005, on the completion of the final work of his ten play cycle-surely the most ambitious American dramatic project undertaken in our history-<b>August Wilson</b> disclosed his bout with cancer, an illness of unusual ferocity that would eventually claim his life on October 2. Fittingly the Broadway theatre where his last play will be produced in 2006 has been renamed the August Wilson Theater in his honor. His legacy will animate the theatre and stir the human heart for decades to come.</p></p><p>August Wilson is the most influential and successful African American playwright writing today. He is the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Fences, The Piano Lesson, King Hedley II, Ma Rainy&#39;s Black Bottom, Joe Turner&#39;s Come and Gone, Seven Guitars, Two Trains Running, Jitney and Radio Golf. His plays have been produced all over the world.</p><h2>Forgotten Armies : The Fall of British Asia, 1941-1945</h2><p>The vast crescent of British-ruled territories from India down to Singapore appeared in the early stages of the Second World War a massive asset in the war with Germany, providing huge quantities of soldiers and raw materials and key part of an impregnable global network denied to the Nazis. Within a few weeks in 1941-2 a Japanese invasion had destroyed all this, almost effortlessly taking the impregnable fortress&#39; of Singapore with its 80,000 strong garrison, and sweeping through South and Southeast Asia to the frontier of India itself. This revolutionary, absolutely gripping book brings to life the entire experience of South and Southeast Asia in this extraordinary period, telling the story from an Indian, Burmese, Chinese or Malay perspective as much as from that of the British or Japanese. Effectively it is the story of the birth of modern South and Southeast Asia and the hopes and fears of the dozens of forgotten armies&#39; marching through the jungle battlefields, so many dying for causes swept away by the reality that emerged in 1945. Even as the British successfully fought back in the bloodiest battles in South and Southeast Asia&#39;s history, there was no going back to colonial rule.</p><p>Christopher Bayly is Vere Harmsworth Professor of Imperial and Naval History, University of Cambridge and a Fellow of St Catharine&#39;s College, Cambridge.

Among Fromme's many associates interviewed by former New York Times reporter Bravin is Phil Hartman, a high school acquaintance of Fromme's who later became famous on NBC's Saturday Night Live. His recollections of Fromme are bittersweet and provide some of the more compelling material here. However, large lapses remain, not the least of which is the suggestion, never resolved, of incest involving Fromme and her authoritarian father. And Bravin glosses over the two decades since Fromme's conviction in a mere ten pages. Perhaps there are so many loose ends here because Fromme would not agree to be interviewed. She might have, had she known that she would receive such delicate treatment from Bravin. While he pulls no punches concerning Fromme's devotion to Charles Manson, her political views concerning the environment, which she used as an excuse for her crime, are presented virtually unedited, no doubt thanks to Bravin's thorough study of the court transcripts and Fromme's own writings. Bravin seems to want his readers to conclude that Fromme had a good cause, after all. The problem is that she stated her cause--that we are killing ourselves by killing our environment--by saying, in essence, ``Stop killing yourself slowly, or I will kill you quickly.'' Bravin tries hard to make her somewhat sympathetic, but ultimately the reader concludes that Fromme is where she belongs--serving out a life sentence in prison in Marianna, Fla. Bravin's research on the crucial years is admirable, but his final product is incomplete and only intermittently interesting. (16 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) (First serial to Buzz magazine; author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Would-be presidential assassin, erstwhile groupie, eco-activist, keeper of the Manson Family faith during Charlie's imprisonment, Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme rubbed elbows with fame and the famous. Bravin not only connects with the Manson Family, including its involvement with certain of the late '60s entertainment glitterati, better than anyone since Ed Sanders in <i>The Family</i>, but he also goes beyond it to consider details as small as the reasoning behind Fromme's apparel when she went to shoot Gerald Ford: her "red ceremonial gown, to wear when she went about her work cleaning the earth. That's what she was on today, a cleaning mission." Yet so powerful was Manson's influence on her and so durable her commitment to Charlie's revealed truth that the Manson Family experience remains the core of her story. Bravin's disturbing but fascinating effort is significant for its new perspective on the Manson phenomenon. As either cautionary tale or gruesome pleasure reading, it should satisfy thrill seekers, Manson obsessives, and other portions of the true-crime audience. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>Perfectly Popular (The Wish Fairy #3) (3)</h2><p>With just four wishes left from her fairy friend Calla, Brooke is determined to make them count.

Human beings settled in Amazonia ten thousand years ago and learned to live well on its bounty. Europeans first saw the Amazon around 1500 and started settling there in the seventeenth century. Always in fear or awe of the jungle, they tried in vain to introduce crops and livestock.</p><p>John Hemming's account of the river and its history is full of larger-than-life personalities this unique environment attracted: explorers, missionaries, and naturalists among them. By the nineteenth century, Amazonian natives had almost been destroyed by alien diseases and slavery, as well as violent class rebellion. Although the rubber industry created huge fortunes, it too was at a fearful cost in human misery.</p><p>In the last hundred years, the Amazon has seen intrepid explorers, entreprenurial millionaires, and political extremists taking refuge in jungle retreats. Alongside them, natural scientists, anthropologists, and archaeologists have sought to discover the secrets of this mighty habitat.</p><p>Today, the world's appetite for timber, beef, and soya is destroying this great tropical forest. Hemming explains why the Amazon is environmentally crucial to survival and brilliantly describes the passionate struggles to exploit and protect it.</p></p><p>Formerly the Director of the Royal Geographical Society in London, <strong>John Hemming</strong> has traveled in and written extensively about the Amazon region. His previous books include <em>Tree of Rivers</em>.<p> Reviewed by Edgardo Krebs</p><p>In "Atlas," a book about travel, Jorge Luis Borges wrote that we should not assume all discoveries and explorations to be things of the past. No place can justify this assertion more literally than the Amazon basin. Dominated by the longest river in the world, its geography extends over a surface the size of Europe, much of it inaccessible. The river is the center of a web of life -- </p><p>plants, insects, fish, reptiles, birds, mammals -- dauntingly richer than any other region's on Earth. Its rainforests also serve as home or refuge to a resilient diversity of Indian groups, some of whom, in dwindling numbers, still refuse contact with the larger world, the maker and narrator of history. Yet, this impressive list of attributes can also lure us to imagine the Amazon in mythical terms, or to misrepresent it or take it for granted.</p><p> The stories John Hemming tells in Tree of Rivers are a passionate corrective to many stereotypes of this complex area and its history. An explorer, former director of the Royal Geographical Society and author of three scholarly books on the Amazon as well as one on the conquest of Peru, Hemming has dedicated a lifetime of research to the Amazon and knows his vast topic with a rigorous intimacy.</p><p> The book has 11 chapters, spanning a range of historical periods and subjects, from the little publicized (but engrossing) archaeology of the region to present-day problems of deforestation and climate change. Each chapter is a self-contained essay. Taken together, they read like the Thousand and One Nights of the Amazon, a rich, multifaceted narrative that strives to mirror the place itself.</p><p> Some stories will be familiar to the informed reader. The first navigation of the Amazon, for instance, undertaken by Francisco de Orellana in 1542, was "one of the greatest explorations of all time" in Hemming's judgment, a tropical match for Shackleton's Antarctic odyssey. The voyage was chronicled by the Dominican friar Gaspar de Carvajal, who lost an eye in a skirmish with Indians and survived the strike of an arrow that pierced his ribs. Carvajal's report was the first panoramic portrait of the Amazon and the Indians who lived on the banks of the watery maze. Carvajal described the populous villages of the Omagua, for instance, whose glazed, enameled and "vividly colored" pottery he judged as "the finest in the world." Hemming also speculates that the tall, pale female Amazon warriors Orellana claimed to have seen were, in fact, long-haired Wai Wai men, "Carib-speaking peoples who now live several days' journey up the Mapuera and Trombetas rivers." </p><p>Another familiar story is that of the infamous Basque soldier Lope de Aguirre, a brooding member of the Pedro de Urs�a expedition, who made his way down the Amazon in 1560. Hemming is not partial to the Werner Herzog/Klaus Kinski film "Aguirre, the Wrath of God," which recounts this feverish, failed search for El Dorado. But the madness and mayhem that took over the traveling party is a fitting topic for German expressionism, and madness itself is one of the recurring human shadows cast over the landscape of the Amazon. As all these expeditions floated downstream on precarious canoes, their soldiers, priests and adventurers kept a notary's eye on things, drafting and signing documents addressed to the king of Spain every time murder or an act of treason occurred. They knew that their ultimate fate would be decided at court. </p><p> For the Indians of the Amazon, the encounter with Europeans was devastating from the beginning. In 1556, Spanish settlers in the Peruvian hamlet of Chachapoyas "were amazed by the arrival of a flotilla of indigenous canoes" carrying around 300 Indians -- survivors of a party that had walked and paddled up stream for 10 years to flee the Portuguese colonies on the Atlantic coast.</p><p> The tree of rivers became a net for trapping Indians and conveying them to the coast and to settlements upriver. The settlements were run mercilessly as systems of production with native men, women and children providing expendable slave labor. "A few thousand colonists," Hemming states, "gradually destroyed every human being along thousands of kilometers of the main river and its tributaries." Some of the episodes he recounts -- the burning of entire villages, the raping of women in front of their children -- are reminiscent of the experiences of present-day villagers in Darfur. These were the precursors of the Belgian King Leopold's brutal operatives in the Congo. In the 17th century, in the Mato Grosso of Brazil, that heart of darkness belonged to Ant�nio Rap�so Tavares, "the toughest of all the slavers operating out of the distant southern town of Sao Paulo." </p><p>Other characters, much less known, such as Curt Nimuendaj� and Colonel C�ndido Rondon, illustrate the loftier aspects of human nature. Rondon was Theodore Roosevelt's guide in the almost deadly (for Roosevelt) River of Doubt expedition. An orphan and descendant of Bororo Indians, Rondon was, in Hemming's estimation, "Brazil's most intrepid explorer," that country's "answer to Dr. David Livingstone." Rondon surveyed and mapped an enormous swath of unknown territory and then published a series of reports of great ethnographic value. He became an advocate for Indian rights, founded the Indian Protection Service, and admonished his urban audiences to "tremble with indignation and shame" at the genocidal slaughter of the native population. "Die if you must, but never kill" was his advice to "men confronting hostile tribes." </p><p> Nimuendaj�, on the other hand, was born Curt Unkel, in Jena, Germany. Fascinated by South American Indians since childhood, he immigrated, penniless, to Brazil in 1903. He is probably one of the most admirable anthropologists in history. His technique was to spend as much time as possible with a tribe, learn its language and thoroughly document its way of life. He authored monographs on 45 tribes. "Perhaps because he was self-taught," Hemming remarks wryly, "he wrote in jargon-free prose." The Guarani gave him the name Nimuendaj� ("He who resides among us"), which he adopted as his legal name when he became a Brazilian citizen. </p><p> The Amazon, in the collective imagination, is a synonym for nature. One shortcoming in Hemming's narrative is his failure to note that Indians have a completely different way of understanding this concept -- or lack anything resembling it. The French ethnologist Claude L�vi-Strauss (who will turn 100 this November) was the first to systematize the complex intellectual heritage of Amazonian Indians. He famously wrote: "Indians use animals to think." Conservationists, who rightly abhor the prospect of invaluable rainforest being replaced by soybean plantations stretching to the horizon, pin their hopes on government protected areas and Indian stewardship. Yet they may not always acknowledge that Indians and biologists operate within different taxonomies, and do not see "nature" eye-to-eye.</p><p> The modernist Brazilian writers and painters of the 1920s realized that new symbols were needed to understand the country's hybrid history and culture. "Tupi or not Tupi?" asked the poet-polemicist Olegario Andrade in his Cannibal Manifesto, capturing the spirit of the moment. Turning the negative European perceptions of Tupi cannibalism on its head, Andrade suggested that Brazilians would achieve a true sense of nation only when they embraced their indigenous ancestry and, in a metaphorical cannibal feast, ate the world. </p><p> Hemming does not engage in such symbolic and psychological questions. Tree of Rivers is a straightforward, majestic narrative, told in many voices, with a multitude of characters, and composed by a scholar and explorer who has earned a rightful place in the history of the region. </p><p></p><p><br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Morgan Cleary fanned herself and wished she hadn&#39;t dressed up. She might have known that no one else would. The mayor sat in shorts and a T-shirt that advertised his favorite beer. One of the city councilmen wore a Panama hat and flipflops. Sarah Williford, the newest member of the Cape Refuge City Council, looked as if she&#39;d come in from a day of surfing and hadn&#39;t even bothered to stop by the shower. She wore a spandex top that looked like a bathing suit and a pair of cutoff jeans. Her long hair could have used a brush. The council members sat with relaxed arrogance, rocking back and forth in the executive chairs they&#39;d spent too much money on. Their critics---which included almost everyone in town---thought they should have used that money to fix the potholes in the roads that threaded through the island. But Morgan was glad the council was comfortable. She didn&#39;t want them irritable when her parents spoke. The mayor&#39;s nasal drone moved to the next item on the agenda. &#39;I was going to suggest jellyfish warning signs at some of the more popular sites on the beach, but Doc Spencer tells me he ain&#39;t seen too many patients from stings in the last week or so---&#39; &#39;Wait, Fred,&#39; Sarah interrupted without the microphone. &#39;Just because they&#39;re not stinging this week doesn&#39;t mean they won&#39;t be stinging next week. My sign shop would give the city a good price on a design for a logo of some kind to put up on all the beaches, warning people of possible jellyfish attacks.&#39; &#39;Jellyfish don&#39;t attack,&#39; the mayor said, his amplified voice giving everyone a start. &#39;Well, I can see you never got stung by one.&#39; &#39;How you gonna draw a picture of &#39;em when you can&#39;t hardly see &#39;em?&#39; Everyone laughed, and Sarah threw back some comment that couldn&#39;t be heard over the noise. Morgan leaned over Jonathan, her husband, and nudged her sister. &#39;Blair, what should we do?&#39; she whispered. &#39;We&#39;re coming up on the agenda. Where are Mama and Pop?&#39; Blair tore her amused eyes from the sight at the front of the room and checked her watch. &#39;Somebody needs to go check on them,&#39; she whispered. &#39;Do you believe these people? I&#39;m so proud to have them serving as my elected officials.&#39; &#39;This is a waste of time,&#39; Jonathan said. He&#39;d been angry and stewing all day, mostly at Morgan&#39;s parents, but also at her. His leather-tanned face was sunburned from the day&#39;s fishing, but he was clean and freshly shaven. He hadn&#39;t slept much last night, and the fatigue showed in the lines of his face. &#39;Just wait,&#39; she said, stroking his arm. &#39;When Mama and Pop get here, it&#39;ll be worth it.&#39; He set his hand over hers---a silent affirmation that he was putting the angry morning behind him---and got to his feet. &#39;I&#39;m going to find them.&#39; &#39;Good idea,&#39; Morgan said. &#39;Tell them to hurry.&#39; &#39;They don&#39;t need to hurry,&#39; Blair whispered. &#39;We&#39;ve got lots of stuff to cover before they talk about shutting down our bedand- breakfast. Shoot, there&#39;s that stop sign down at Pine and Mimosa. And Goodfellows Grocery has a lightbulb out in their parking lot.&#39; &#39;Now, before we move on,&#39; Fred Hutchins, the mayor, said, studying his notes as if broaching a matter of extreme importance, &#39;I&#39;d like to mention that Chief Cade of the Cape Refuge Police Department tells me he has several leads on the person or persons who dumped that pile of gravel in my parking spot.&#39; A chuckle rippled over the room, and the mayor scowled. &#39;The perpetrator will be prosecuted.&#39; Blair spat out her suppressed laughter, and Morgan slapped her arm. &#39;Shhh,&#39; Morgan tried not to grin, &#39;you&#39;re going to make him mad.&#39; &#39;I&#39;m just picturing a statewide search for the fugitive with the dump truck,&#39; Blair said, &#39;on a gravel-dumping spree across the whole state of Georgia.&#39; Morgan saw the mayor&#39;s eyes fasten on her, and she punched her sister again. Blair drew in a quick breath and tried to straighten up. &#39;The Owenses still ain&#39;t here?&#39; he asked. While Morgan glanced back at the door, Blair shot to her feet. &#39;No, Fred, they&#39;re not here. Why don&#39;t you just move this off the agenda and save it until next week? I&#39;m sure something&#39;s come up.&#39; &#39;Maybe they don&#39;t intend to come,&#39; the mayor said. &#39;Don&#39;t you wish,&#39; Blair fired back. &#39;You&#39;re threatening to shut down their business. They&#39;ll be here, all right.&#39; &#39;Well, I&#39;m tired of waiting,&#39; the mayor said into the microphone, causing feedback to squeal across the room. Everybody covered their ears until Jason Manford got down on his knees and fiddled with the knob. &#39;We&#39;ve moved it down the agenda twice already tonight,&#39; the mayor went on. &#39;If we ever want to get out of here, I think we need to start arguin&#39; this right now.&#39; Morgan got up. &#39;Mayor, there must be something wrong. Jonathan went to see if he could find them. Please, if we could just have a few more minutes.&#39; &#39;We&#39;re not waitin&#39; any longer. Now if anybody from your camp has somethin&#39; to say . . .&#39; &#39;What are you gonna do, Mayor?&#39; Blair asked, pushing up her sleeves and shuffling past the knees and feet on her row. &#39;Shut us down without a hearing? That&#39;s not even legal. You could find yourself slapped with a lawsuit, and then you wouldn&#39;t even have time to worry about jellyfish and gravel. Where would that leave the town?&#39; She marched defiantly past the standing-room-only crowd against the wall to the microphone at the front of the room. Morgan got a queasy feeling in her stomach. Blair wasn&#39;t the most diplomatic of the Owens family. She was an impatient intellectual who found her greatest fulfillment in the books of the library she ran. People were something of a nuisance to her, and she found their pettiness unforgivable. Blair set her hands on her hips. &#39;I&#39;ve been wanting to give you a piece of my mind for a long time now, Fred.&#39; The people erupted into loud chatter, and the mayor banged his gavel to silence them. &#39;As you know, young lady, the city council members and I have agreed that the publicity from the 20/20 show about Hanover House a few months ago brought a whole new element to this town. The show portrayed your folks as willin&#39; to take in any ol&#39; Joe with a past and even exposed some things about one of your current tenants that made the people of this town uncomfortable and afraid. We want to be a familyfriendly tourist town, not a refuge for every ex-con with a probation officer. For that reason, we believe Hanover House is a danger to this town and that it&#39;s in the city&#39;s best interest to close it down under Zoning Ordinance number 503.</p><h2>Fighting Techniques of the Napoleonic Age 1792 - 1815: Equipment, Combat Skills, and Tactics</h2><p><p><i>Fighting Techniques of the Napoleonic World</i> explores the tactics and strategy required to win battles with the technology available during the Napoleonic period (1789-1815), and points out how the development of such weapons technology changed the face of the battlefield.

Since then Captain Bruce Cathie has been the premier investigator into the amazing potential of the infinite energy that surrounds our planet every microsecond. The Harmonic Conquest of Spacecontains all new material and further explores the concept that the earth is criss-crossed by an electromagnetic grid system that can be used for anti-gravity, free energy, levitation and more. Chapters include: Mathematics of the World Grid; the Harmonics of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; Harmonic Transmission and Receiving; the Link Between Human Brain Waves; the Cavity Resonance Between the Earth; the Ionosphere and Gravity; Edgar Cayce-the Harmonics of the Subconscious; Stonehenge; the Harmonics of the Moon; the Pyramids of Mars; Nikola Tesla&#39;s Electric Car; the Robert Adams Pulsed Electric Motor Generator; Harmonic Clues to the Unified Field; and more. Also included in the book are tables showing the harmonic relations between the Earth&#39;s magnetic field, the speed of light, and anti-gravity/gravity acceleration at different points on the Earth&#39;s surface.</p><p>Bruce L. Cathie</p><h2>Anni Albers (Paperback) /anglais</h2><p>Anni Albers (1899-1994) was a textile designer, weaver, writer and printmaker, who was among the leading pioneers of twentieth-century modernism. Throughout her fruitful career she inspired a reconsideration of fabrics, both in their functional roles and as wall hangings, truly establishing thread and weaving as a valid medium for art. In her later years, Albers took up print-making, translating many of her persistent themes and ideas into two-dimensional form. But while Albers has been extremely influential for younger generations of artists and designers, her contribution to modernist art history has, until now, been rather overlooked. In 2018, a groundbreaking exhibition, together with this accompanying publication will present Albers&#39;s most important works to fully explore and redefine her contribution to twentieth-century art and design, and highlight Albers&#39;s significance as an artist in her own right, rather than alongside her husband Josef . Contextualising Albers&#39;s early career at the Bauhaus, and her teaching years at Black Mountain College, this beautifully illustrated book will showcase major commissioned works, wall hangings, designs for commercial use, drawings and studies, jewellery designed and made by Albers and a selection of her prints. A series of short texts from a range of experts will focus on key works and themes, relating aspects of Albers&#39;s practice to her seminal texts On Designing and On Weaving, and drawing in broader contextual material, including examples of Andean textiles which Albers collected and in which she found intense inspiration for her understanding of woven thread as a form of language. Illuminating Albers&#39;s skill as a weaver, her material awareness and acute understanding of art and design, this much-needed publication is a celebration of one of the most influential artists of the twentieth century, and her endless creativity.</p><p>Ann Coxon is Curator of International Art, at Tate.

The sky's darkness was pushed away, an unwelcome guest on this the first night of the Gedderone Fete. Throngs filled the streets of Darujhistan, happily riotous, good- natured in the calamity of one year's ending and another's beginning. The night air was humid and pungent with countless scents. <p></p>There had been banquets. There had been unveilings of eligible young men and maidens. Tables laden with exotic foods, ladies wrapped in silks, men and women in preposterous uniforms all glittering gilt - a city with no standing army bred a plethora of private militias and a chaotic proliferation of high ranks held, more or less exclusively, by the nobility. <p></p>Among the celebrations she had attended this evening, on the arm of her husband, she had not once seen a real officer of Darujhistan's City Watch, not one genuine soldier with a dusty cloak- hem, with polished boots bearing scars, with a sword- grip of plain leather and a pommel gouged and burnished by wear. Yet she had seen, bound high on soft, well- fed arms, torcs in the manner of decorated soldiers among the Malazan army - soldiers from an empire that had, not so long ago, provided for Darujhistan mothers chilling threats to belligerent children. <i>'Malazans, child! Skulking in the night to steal foolish children! To make you slaves for their terrible Empress - yes! Here in this very city!</i>' <p></p>But the torcs she had seen this night were not the plain bronze or faintly etched silver of genuine Malazan decorations and signi.ers of rank, such as appeared like relics from some long- dead cult in the city's market stalls. No, these had been gold, studded with gems, the blue of sapphire being the commonest hue even among the coloured glass, blue like the blue .re for which the city was famous, blue to proclaim some great and brave service to Darujhistan itself. <p></p>Her fingers had pressed upon one such torc, there on her husband's arm, although there was real muscle beneath it, a hardness to match the contemptuous look in his eyes as he surveyed the clusters of nobility in the vast humming hall, with the proprietary air he had acquired since attaining the Council. The contempt had been there long before and if anything had grown since his latest and most triumphant victory. <p></p>Daru gestures of congratulation and respect had swirled round them in their stately passage through the crowds, and with each acknowledgement her husband's face had grown yet harder, the arm beneath her fingers drawing ever tauter, the knuckles of his hands whitening above his sword- belt where the thumbs were tucked into braided loops in the latest fashion among duellists. Oh, he revelled in being among them now; indeed, in being above many of them. But for Gorlas Vidikas, this did not mean he had to like any of them. The more they fawned, the deeper his contempt, and that he would have been offended without their obsequy was a contradiction, she suspected, that a man like her husband was not wont to entertain. <p></p>The nobles had eaten and drunk, and stood and posed and wandered and paraded and danced themselves into swift exhaustion, and now the banquet halls and staterooms echoed with naught but the desultory ministrations of servants. Beyond the high walls of the estates, however, the common folk rollicked still in the streets. Masked and half naked, they danced on the cobbles - the riotous whirling steps of the Flaying of Fander - as if dawn would never come, as if the hazy moon itself would stand motionless in the abyss in astonished witness to their revelry. City Watch patrols simply stood back and observed, drawing dusty cloaks about their bodies, gauntlets rustling as they rested hands on truncheons and swords. <p></p>On the balcony where she stood, the fountain of the unlit garden directly below chirped and gurgled to itself, buffered by the estate's high, solid walls from the raucous festivities they had witnessed during the tortured carriage ride back home. Smeared moonlight struggled in the softly swirling pool surrounding the fountain. <p></p>The blue fire was too strong this night, too strong even for the mournful moon. Darujhistan itself was a sapphire, blazing in the torc of the world. And yet its beauty, and all its delighted pride and its multitudinous voice, could not reach her tonight. <p></p>This night, Lady Vidikas had seen her future. Each and every year of it. There on her husband's hard arm. And the moon, well, it looked like a thing of the past, a memory dimmed by time, yet it had taken her back. <p></p>To a balcony much like this one in a time that now seemed very long ago. <p></p>Lady Vidikas, who had once been Challice Estraysian, had just seen her future. And was discovering, here in this night and standing against this rail, that the past was a better place to be. <p></p>Talk about the worst night yet to run out of Rhivi flatbread. Swearing under her breath, Picker pushed her way through the crowds of the Lakefront market, the mobs of ferociously hungry, drunk revellers, using her elbows when she needed to and glowering at every delirious smile swung her way, and came out eventually at the mouth of a dingy alley heaped ankle- deep in rubbish. Somewhere just to the south of Borthen Park. Not quite the route back to the bar she would have preferred, but the fete was in full frenzy. Wrapped package of flatbread tucked under her left arm, she paused to tug loose the tangles of her heavy cloak, scowled on seeing a fresh stain from a careless passer- by - some grotesque Gadrobi sweetcake - tried wiping it off which only made it worse, then, her mood even fouler, set out through the detritus. <p></p>With the Lady's pull, Bluepearl and Antsy had fared better in finding Saltoan wine and were even now back at K'rul's. And here she was, twelve streets and two wall passages away with twenty or thirty thousand mad fools in between. Would her companions wait for her? Not a chance. Damn Blend and her addiction to Rhivi flatbread! That and her sprained ankle had conspired to force Picker out here on the first night of the fete - if that ankle truly <i>was</i> sprained, and she had her doubts since Mallet had just squinted down at the offending appendage, then shrugged. <p></p>Mind you, that was about as much as anyone had come to expect from Mallet. He'd been miserable since the retirement, and the chance of the sun's rising any time in the healer's future was about as likely as Hood's forgetting to tally the count. And it wasn't as if he was alone in his misery, was it? <p></p>But where was the value in feeding her ill temper with all these well- chewed thoughts? Well, it made her feel better, that's what. <p></p>Dester Thrin, wrapped tight in black cloak and hood, watched the big- arsed woman kicking her way through the rubbish at the other end of the alley. He'd picked her up coming out of the back door of K'rul's Bar, the culmination of four nights positioned in the carefully chosen, darkness- shrouded vantage point from which he could observe that narrow postern. <p></p>His clan- master had warned that the targets were all ex- soldiers, but Dester Thrin had seen little to suggest that any of them had kept .t and trim. They were old, sagging, rarely sober, and this one, well, she wore that huge, thick woollen cloak because she was getting heavy and it clearly made her self- conscious. <p></p>Following her through the crowds had been relatively easy - she was a head taller than the average Gadrobi, and the route she took to this decrepit Rhivi market in Lakefront seemed to deliberately avoid the Daru streets, some strange affectation that would, in a very short time, prove fatal. <p></p>Dester's own Daru blood had permitted him a clear view of his target, pushing purposefully through the heaving press of celebrants. <p></p>He set out to traverse the alley once his target exited at the far end. Swiftly padding at a hunter's pace, he reached the alley mouth and edged out, in time to see the woman move into the passageway through Second Tier Wall, with the tunnel through Third just beyond. <p></p>The Guild's succession wars, following the disappearance of Vorcan, had finally been settled, with only a minimum amount of spilled blood. And Dester was more or less pleased with the new Grand Master, who was both vicious and clever where most of the other aspirants had been simply vicious. At last, an assassin of the Guild did not have to be a fool to feel some optimism regarding the future. <p></p>This contract was a case in point. Straightforward, yet one sure to earn Dester and the others of his clan considerable prestige upon its summary completion. <p></p>He brushed his gloved hands across the pommels of his daggers, the weapons slung on baldrics beneath his arms. Ever reassuring, those twin blades of Daru steel with their ferules filled with the thick, pasty poison of Moranth tralb. <p></p>Poison was now the preferred insurance for a majority of the Guild's street killers, and indeed for more than a few who scuttled Thieves' Road across the rooftops. There'd been an assassin, close to Vorcan herself, who had, on a night of betrayal against his own clan, demonstrated the deadliness of fighting without magic. Using poison, the assassin had proved the superiority of such mundane substances in a single, now legendary night of blood. <p></p>Dester had heard that some initiates in some clans had raised hidden shrines to honour Rallick Nom, creating a kind of cult whose adherents employed secret gestures of mutual recognition within the Guild. Of course, Seba Krafar, the new Grand Master, had in one of his very first pronouncements outlawed the cult, and there had been a cull of sorts, with five suspected cult leaders greeting the dawn with smiling throats. <p></p>Still, Dester had since heard enough hints to suggest that the cult was far from dead. It had just burrowed deeper. <p></p>In truth, no one knew which poisons Rallick Nom had used, but Dester believed it was Moranth tralb, since even the smallest amount in the bloodstream brought unconsciousness, then a deeper coma that usually led to ...<br><br></p><h2>Know the Truth: A Handbook of Christian Belief</h2><p>Bruce Milne helps readers develop a systematic theology in this handbook.

Research by Dr. Carol Dweck and colleagues has shown, in impressive detail, that children's beliefs about the nature of intelligence--as being either malleable or fixed--can greatly impact both their attitude towards learning and their academic achievement.&nbsp;It is far better to believe in a malleable rather than a fixed notion of intelligence. Thus it is a delight to see books like the present one put much needed, and scientifically credible, tools in the hands of educators, parents, and children." <br>Dr. Jeremy Gray, Yale University <br>Professor of Psychology<br> "The Mainstream Connections book series teaches that challenges and differences are part of the spice of life, not something to hide or fear. Each child in the series faces a challenge that makes him or her feel different and maybe not as good as other kids. Young readers will learn the value of facing challenges directly, and to respect everyone's unique challenges. Success comes from practice and improvement, especially on the things that are hardest to do." <br>Dr. Brian Nosek, University of Virginia<br>Professor of Psychology<br> The Mainstream Connections Children's Book Series conveys a message that could have been lifted straight from a psychology research journal: there is more than one way to define being smart . As these stories illustrate, for every person, large and small, there are skills that are relatively difficult to master and others that seem to come more naturally. These books emphasize the important empirical conclusion that just as regular exercise makes the body stronger, so, too, does practice and the effort to improve academically--with all the struggle, fatigue, and initial failure that it entails--allow people to capitalize on the malleable nature of human intelligence. <br>Dr. Samuel R.

But practicing Christians, at least, want to be ethical in all areas of life and work--not just when they are holding four aces. To those faced with the many questions and quandaries of doing business with integrity, Alexander Hill offers a place to begin. Alexander Hill carefully explores the foundational Christian concepts of holiness, justice and love. These keys to God&#39;s character, he argues, are also the keys to Christian business ethics. Hill then shows how some common responses to business ethics fall short of a fully Christian response. Finally, he turns to penetrating case studies on such pressing topics as employer-employee relations, discrimination and affirmative action, and environmental damage. This is an excellent introduction to business ethics for students and a bracing refresher for men and women already in the marketplace.</p><p>Alexander Hill is president emeritus of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA, based in Madison, Wisconsin. He formerly taught in the School of Business and Economics at Seattle Pacific University."Alec Hill has crafted an unusual volume. This book is solidly based on a biblical theological foundation ('how come?' questions are more important than 'how to?' questions); it is richly spiced with case studies and illustrations (there is both heat and light); and it offers a most welcome concordance of Scripture references. Hill places the business enterprise in the expansive context of vocation of calling, that liberating summons of God to live first for someone and then for something." (Paul Stevens, Professor Emeritus of Marketplace Theology and Leadership, Regent College)<br><br>"Business practitioners are in sore need of an ethical framework which applies eternal principles to everyday marketplace decisions. Based on scriptural norms of holiness, justice and love, <em>Just Business</em> provides such a framework. I highly recommend it."

It is an excellent tool for managers who struggle with how to apply Christian ethics in the marketplace. <em>Just Business</em> is full of challenge and hope--well-written, balanced and informative."

Through details on the couple&#39;s most intimate moments, including Jackie&#39;s defloration in a Paris elevator, and her amusing, albeit catty, disposition (kept under wraps because of her political standing), the ivory tower of their existence seems less out of reach. With chapter titles such as &#34;Indiscreet,&#34; &#34;Love Lies Bleeding,&#34; and &#34;Pleasure First&#34; the book reads a bit like a romance novel, but with a biting touch of reality.Of all the great love stories that have had an impact on our times-- Eleanor and Franklin, Winston and Clementine, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor-- none has remained as shrouded in secrecy and misunderstanding as that of John and Jacqueline Kennedy. Here, for the first time, their story is told the way it was always meant to be told-- with such depth and amazing detail that it sheds a whole new light on the relationship at the heart of Camelot. For many years, Edward Klein, the former editor in chief of <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, was a friend of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Drawing on his personal knowledge, major research libraries, private documents and correspondence, FBI files, and more than three hundred interviews, <i>All Too Human</i> is an original and unprecedented work on the Kennedys-- a book replete with fresh facts and information, as well as a dramatically new interpretation of the Kennedy marriage. The story begins on the very day that Jack and Jackie met in May 1951, and it unfolds before the reader's eyes in a series of dramatic scenes, culminating with the President's assassination in November 1963. Since that bloody day in Dallas, the world has been intensely curious about the bonds that united Jack and Jackie. The book answers these questions: <li> Was Jack in love with Jackie? And was she in love with him? </li><li> Did Jack's father, Joseph Kennedy, arrange his son's marriage? </li><li> Did events on their honeymoon shape the future course of their marriage? </li><li> To what extent was Jackie aware of Jack's compulsive womanizing, and how did she react? </li><li>Did Jackie have affairs of her own? </li><li> Did the enormous strains of the presidency-- and the tragic death of their infant son Patrick-- draw Jack and Jackie closer together? Rigorously researched and richly textured, <i>All Too Human</i> reveals the private husband and wife behind the grand image. Much more than a portrait of a marriage, Edward Klein's journalistic tour de force captures the essence of an unforgettable man and an extraordinary woman in their momentous years together: two fascinating individuals whose haunting love story is captured in these pages as never before.</li></p><h2>A World Destroyed: Hiroshima and the Origins of the Arms Race</h2><p>Martin J.

Celebrated poet and bestselling author Robert Bly has been asking these questions throughout his career. Here Bly looks at six tales that have stood the test of time and have captivated the poet for decades, from &#x201c;The Six Swans&#x201d; to &#x201c;The Frog Prince.&#x201d; Drawing on his own creative genius, and the work of a range of thinkers from Kirkegaard and Yeats to Freud and Jung, Bly turns these stories over in his mind to bring new meaning and illumination to these timeless tales. </p><p>Along with illustrations of each story, the book features some of Bly's unpublished poetry, which peppers his lyric prose and offers a look inside the mind of an American master of letters in the twilight of his singular career.</p></p><p><b>Robert Bly</b> is an American poet, author, activist and leader of the mythopoetic men's movement. His book <i>Iron John: A Book About Men</i> was a key text of the movement, and spent 62 weeks on <i>The New York Times </i>bestseller list. He won the 1968 National Book Award for poetry for his book<i> The Light Around the Body</i>. He lives in Minneapolis, MN.<p>"A terrific blend of the timeless and the modern. . . .an in-depth exploration of human psychology. . . .a blend of the comforts of the oral storytelling tradition with the rigor of the modern analytic approach &#x2015; sometimes heady, sometimes contemplative. . . .a bold blend of storytelling traditions and psychological explorations." &#x2015;<b><i>The Star Tribune</i></b></p><p>"In <i>More Than True</i>, Robert Bly takes us down in his critical diving bell through the fathoms of Jung and Freud then deeper still into his own poetic configuring of these mythic tales. The result of the exploration is a refreshened, multivalent view or some of our culture's fundamental stories registered in the distinctive voice of a most compelling poet." &#x2015;<b>Billy Collins</b><br><b></b><br>"A great poet observes a complex combination of seemingly random unconnected events and reveals their distilled essence. From the agricultural ditches of snowy Minnesota to the dense forests of fairy tales, Robert has opened my mind time and again to the beauty of this life. Here again, I have to lie down and sleep after reading just one of his reflections on an old story. Sometimes only a dream will digest a great piece of writing. Thank you, Robert." <b>&#x2015;Mark Rylance, actor</b></p><p>&#x201c;Robert Bly's <i>More Than True</i> has elements of both a guidebook and a spiritual autobiography, and its shrewd commentary on six stories takes us to the heart of several luminous truths that can come alive only in narratives. This book is wise and beguiling, a testament to years of thought.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Charles Baxter</b><br><b></b><br>"Robert Bly&#x2019;s marvelous, wide-ranging adventures in poetry and prose are always fighting off what he calls &#x2018;the dictatorship of the ego,&#x2019; and here he mines six fairy tales for their inner depths, their deep wisdom, and carries back what he knows about Union and Separation, grief and sweetness. <i>More Than True</i> is daring, strange, and exalted." &#x2015;<b>Edward Hirsch</b></p><p>&#x201c;A wonderful, thought-provoking book. Bly&#x2019;s speculative, poetic musings on the hidden meaning of these messages from our distant ancestors throw up even more questions; just like a great poem. Bly gives form and meaning to hidden half-realised messages transmitted to us by our distant ancestors through fairy stories. His insights result in such an overwhelming torrent of ideas in the reader that it is best to take it one chapter at a time. Bly&#x2019;s delightful, provocative, musings show that fairy tales are instruction manuals in the struggle to become emotionally alive and the fight against brutalism and authoritarianism.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Barry Miles, author of <i>Call Me Burroughs: A Life</i></b><br><b><i></i></b><br>"Bly whimsically retells the often idiosyncratic stories in vibrant detail...dissect[ing] their essences with help from the theories of such thinkers as Jung, Kafka, Shelley, and Wang Wei, and he ornaments these ideas with excerpts from his own poems, many never before published...beautiful...[a] gorgeously written book." &#x2015;<b><i>Publishers Weekly </i></b></p><p>"Readings by a generous, gifted writer who asks his readers to be open to a story's poetry, its 'light by which we may see life.'" <b>&#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><b><i></i></b></p></p><h2>The Woodbook</h2><p><p>Culled and assembled by Romeyn Beck Hough between 1888 and 1913 in what still remains a stunning and unparalleled achievement, American Woods&#x2015;originally published in 14 volumes, with actual specimens mounted on card stock&#x2015;is a work of breathtaking beauty that has set the standard for the study of trees and wood.</p><p>TASCHEN&#x2019;s Wood Book reproduces, in painstaking facsimile, all of the specimen pages from the original volumes; for this purpose we have obtained the use of an extremely rare original set of volumes in very good condition, with minimal damage to the cuts of wood.

He is also the author of several art books, including &#34;Art&#34;&#34;Handbook: Painting with Watercolours &#34;and &#34;Painting with Watercolours.&#34;Dec 13 What a pleasant change it is to read a &#34;how to&#34; book on painting by an artist who is self-taught! Perhaps it is not surprising that this is one of Search Press&#39; rare hardcover books as it is something rather special, and in many ways easier to learn from than a book on the same topic by a college taught painter. So how is this book different and deserving of its hard cover? This artist does not merely tell the reader to buy the best but explains why one item works better than another and explodes a few old myths in the process. There is some very up to date advice in here dealing with what is on the market now, and no mention of expensive items like easels. Instead of color wheels there are paintings using a limited palette and advice on mixing, greens in particular to look lifelike. There are exercises to try out to practice certain things such as tonal values, washes, wet into wet etc and various staged projects. These include the usual types of picturesque country view, an Oxford college, a still life of a cannon and a painting of an old man; a nice mix of the invariable and the less obvious. Each project demonstrates some aspect of watercolor painting so you can learn by experience. Throughout the book the artist talks to the reader rather as if he was there in person, giving useful advice and explaining why it is useful. As a largely self-taught painter myself I found this book easier to learn from than those by the more formally trained artists and if this is your background then you might agree with me. This is one of the better books for the total beginner on watercolor painting. * Myshelf.com * Nov 13 This book covers everything you need to know about painting watercolour. From the materials you need to techniques, perspective, drawing and more. Newton is a self-taught artist, who now tutors others. The paintings are admirable. William shows how to create landscapes with a limited palettes of only four colours and gives three examples. He also looks at that difficult colour green. There are six detailed, step by step projects covering a variety of subjects: architecture, landscape, still life and portraiture. Plenty of step by step photos and images of finished work illustrate this handsome book. * Karen Platt Yarnsandfabrics.co.uk/crafts * Nov 13 William Newton has been out of the limelight, as far as books are concerned, for too long. However, this has served to build up his teaching methods through workshops that provide feedback in real life. The result is a collection of sound wisdom - there&#39;s a huge variety of subject matter and there are demonstrations, hints and tips and short paragraphs that are little nuggets of wisdom. William tells us in his introduction that he&#39;s &#39;self-taught&#39;, meaning that he has studied many different artists and analysed their works and working methods. As a result, he knows not just what to learn, but how to learn. * Artist, The * Nov 13 William Newton is a full-time professional artist and tutor with many years&#39; experience teaching both adults and children, so he is well placed to bring us his Complete Guide to Watercolour Painting. From landscapes and seascapes, architecture to portraits, William will take you from first principles to finished watercolour with clear, well-measured advice. There&#39;s plenty of information on handling the medium, including what materials you&#39;ll need, painting techniques, colour and tone, drawing and perspective - as well as detailed step-by-step projects - all illustrated by William&#39;s beautiful work. * Leisure Painter, The * June 14 After providing a short introduction and a solid grounding in basics such as materials, color palettes, painting light, drawing and sketching, watercolor techniques, and subject matter, painter Newton (Art Handbook: Painting with Watercolours) goes on to offer the reader half a dozen step-by-step projects that are considerably more complex than the average painting guidebook. Most projects depict atmospheric yet realistic landscapes, but a still life and a portrait exercise are also included. VERDICT Sophisticated enough for intermediate or advanced artists while accessible enough for those with just a bit of experience drawing or painting, this volume will have wide appeal. * Library Journal, USA * Oct 13 There&#39;s an immediate sense of variety in this admirably comprehensive book that really does live up to its claim to be complete. In something such as this, the introduction to materials and techniques clearly has a place and it&#39;s rightly more extensive than the cursory notes we could usually all probably do without. William is particularly good on the uses and handling of colour and tone as well as core techniques such as wet-in-wet. Although the beginner might feel the need for something more basic at this stage, as long as you&#39;ve got the hang of how to use your materials, you&#39;ll find it easy to pick up from where this starts. William has a simple, relaxed and open style that relies on transparent colours, the use of washes and a constant sense of light that makes for easy and comfortable viewing that is immediately encouraging. The range of subjects is wide and includes landscapes, buildings, boats and people, and there&#39;s also an extensive series of demonstrations that put the basic lessons of the introductory section into practice. Because of its simplicity, the clarity of the instructions and the quality of the execution, I&#39;d say this is the best work of its kind that I&#39;ve seen. * Artbookreview.net * Jan 14 Learn how to paint landscapes, seascapes and portraits in watercolour. All the basic information you need is given in this book. The illustrations are extremely inspiring and beautifully presented. The projects cover scenes of Magdalen College, Barges on the Mud, Farm tracks, village streets. There are useful inset items such as the back view of a fisherman on his way home - a scene which artists are rarely shown how to depict. Other sections focus on subjects such as shadows and glazing, accompanied by an illustration of the statue of Peter Pan in Kensington Palace Gardens as an example of the points being raised in the text. The book is very easy to follow and understand. It is extremely well written and will prove a useful aid to artists of any standard. * Monstersandcritics.com *</p><h2>The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King Vol 3 (The Lord of the Rings)</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

Elizabeth Enright's Melendy Quartet follows siblings Mona, Rush, Miranda (Randy, for short) and Oliver. First published in 1941, The Saturdays kicks off the series and centers on the foursome's Independent Saturday Afternoon Adventure Club (I.S.A.A.C.), an allowance-endowed venture formed so one lucky Melendy can enjoy a solo sojourn each week. In The Four-Story Mistake (1942) the family moves from their city brownstone to the country; Then There Were Five (1944) describes what happens when the siblings befriend an orphan; and in Spiderweb forTwo: A Melendy Maze (1951), when everyone else leaves for school, Randy and Oliver are left to solve a mystery.

And yet, we go through life tacitly assuming (or loudly insisting) that we are right about nearly everything - from our political beliefs to our private memories, from our grasp of scientific fact to the merits of our favourite team. Being Wrong looks at why this conviction has such a powerful grip on us, what happens when this conviction is shaken, and how we interpret the moral, political and psychological significance of being wrong.Drawing on philosophies old and new and cutting-edge neuroscience, Kathryn Schulz offers an eloquent exploration of the allure of certainty and the necessity of fallibility in four main areas: in religion (when the end of the world fails to be nigh); in politics (where were those WMD?); in memory (where did I leave my keys?); and in love (when Mr or Miss Right becomes Mr or Miss Wrong).</p><p><p>To err is human. Yet most of us go through life assuming (and sometimes insisting) that we are right about nearly everything, from the origins of the universe to how to load the dishwasher. In <em>Being Wrong</em>, journalist Kathryn Schulz explores why we find it so gratifying to be right and so maddening to be mistaken. Drawing on thinkers as varied as Augustine, Darwin, Freud, Gertrude Stein, Alan Greenspan, and Groucho Marx, she shows that error is both a given and a gift&#x2014;one that can transform our worldviews, our relationships, and ourselves. </p>KATHRYN SCHULZ has written for a number of US publications from Rolling Stone to the New York Times, on subjects as varied as right-wing film festivals to the impact of antidepressant use on Japanese culture.

Based on the Taoist approach, it reveals how couples can achieve numerous sexual peaks together and cultivate a long-term smouldering passion. The book is illustrated throughout - with soft and appealing rather than &#34;medical&#34; images. The guide include: the pool of pleasure - women&#39;s desire, any woman can increase her pleasure by learning to circulate sexual energy and make the whole body orgasmic; fireworks - multiple orgasms for men; pleasuring each other - discovering the deep harmony between male and female; and &#34;before you call the sex therapist&#34; - a healthy approach to problems with sex.</p><p>Harmonizing sexual energy is paramount for paramours. Taoists see men's sexual energy as fire, quick to ignite and extinguish (hence the post-coital grunt-and-roll phenomenon), while women's energy is water, slower to boil but longer lasting. Further, in this view a woman's sexual energy starts in her head and "trickles down" over her heart to her genitals, while a man's energy ignites in the genitals and flares up past his heart to his mind.<p> The early Taoists were physicians as well as sexologists, and their centuries-old teachings encourage sex not only for pleasure and intimacy, but for lifelong health, creativity, and longevity. Orgasm is something to cultivate and pursue weekly if not daily, although men learn to separate ejaculation from orgasm and often forgo the former. Coauthored by four longtime practitioners of Taoist sexuality, this book does what <i>The Joy of Sex</i> did for millions of readers: it shines a clear light into foggy areas of sex that have been shrouded, overly mystified, or misunderstood. The 50-odd drawings here, in fact, were created by the same illustrator. Thai author Mantak Chia has done an admirable job with his coauthors of making the mystifying concepts of sexual energy so vivid.</p><p> Taoist sexuality is, above all, rooted in nature and in the physical. The authors first teach basic exercises like belly breathing and PC-muscle toning (Kegels aren't just for women anymore), as well as pulling energy down from the head to the genitals, circulating sexual energy in the mind, and sharing life-giving energy with a partner. Taoist sex is all about energy flow. "Your genitals and spine are like a water wheel that draws the energy up your spine and then pours it into your head to replenish your brain. From there it flows down like a waterfall into your abdomen, where it can be stored in a life-giving reservoir of energy." The 28 exercises here all teach a deeper energetic sensitivity within oneself before cultivating the flow of sexual energy with a partner.

Tolkien.</p> <p>Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable, unambitious life, rarely travelling further than the pantry of his hobbit-hole in Bag End.</p> <p>But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard, Gandalf, and a company of thirteen dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an unexpected journey &#x2018;there and back again&#x2019;. They have a plot to raid the treasure hoard of Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon...</p> <p>The prelude to The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit has sold many millions of copies since its publication in 1937, establishing itself as one of the most beloved and influential books of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><i>"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</i> <p> The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a "little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves." He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure," Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.</p><p> The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, would eventually spring. Though <i>The Hobbit</i> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too. By the time Bilbo returns to his comfortable hobbit-hole, he is a different person altogether, well primed for the bigger adventures to come--and so is the reader. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p><b>Scenes from <em>The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies</em></b></p> <em> </em> Luke Evans as Bard and Orlando Bloom as Legolas in The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, in theatres December 17, 2014.

Lacerte and I am the Vice President of the Ohana Kenpo Karate Association, and a 6th Degree Black Belt in Ed Parkers&#39; American Kenpo Karate. Inside these books you will find requirements from the ranks of Yellow Belt through 4th Degree Black Belt. I began this project back around 1990 just after the passing of our beloved Senior Grand Master Edmund K. Parker. I made a call to Mrs. Leileni Parker (Ed Parkers&#39; wife and then President of the IKKA) to see if they would be continuing their Manuals of Kenpo. At that time, they had only had published the Green Belt Manual (later they Published the 3rd and 2nd Degree Brown Belt Manuals), but she informed me that would be it, because I already had earlier purchased 3 copies of the Accumulative Journal, as well as my personal training, I knew there was much more to offer. I expressed my desire to have more knowledge through the Manuals, and she said to me (Phone Conversation), &#34;We were going to do this but many instructors could not understand them, therefore we&#39;re not&#34; Well I felt slighted; I really enjoyed these Manuals because they reflected upon what I was teaching. Well it was then I began to put down all information on what I had to offer, this was through Research of many different Manuals, Ed Parkers&#39; many Books and Magazine articles, and the many Notes that I had taken in Seminars and Work-shops throughout the United States as well as from my Instructors.

ONE LIVING IN TRENTON in July is like living inside a big pizza oven. Hot, airless, aromatic. Because I didn&#x2019;t want to miss any of the summer experience I had the sunroof open on my Honda CRX. My brown hair was pulled up into a wind-snarled, curls-gone-to-frizz ponytail. The sun baked the top of my head, and sweat trickled under my black spandex sports bra. I was wearing matching spandex shorts and a sleeveless oversized Trenton Thunders baseball jersey. It was an excellent outfit except it gave me no place to stick my .38. Which meant I was going to have to borrow a gun to shoot my cousin Vinnie. I parked the CRX in front of Vinnie&#x2019;s storefront bail bonds office, lunged out of the car, stalked across the sidewalk, and yanked the office door open. &#x201c;Where is he? Where is that miserable little excuse for a human being?&#x201d; &#x201c;Uh oh,&#x201d; Lula said from behind the file cabinet. &#x201c;Rhino alert.&#x201d; Lula is a retired hooker who helps clean up the filing and sometimes rides shotgun for me when I do my fugitive apprehension thing. If people were cars, Lula would be a big, black &#x2019;53 Packard with a high-gloss chrome grille, oversized headlights, and a growl like a junkyard dog. Lots of muscle. Never fit in a compact space. Connie Rosolli, the office manager, pushed back at her desk when I entered. Connie&#x2019;s domain was this one front room where friends and relatives of miscreants came to beg money. And to the rear, in an inner office, my cousin Vinnie slapped Mr. Johnson around and conversed with his bookie. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Connie said, &#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re bummed about, and this wasn&#x2019;t my decision. Personally, if I were you, I&#x2019;d kick your cousin&#x2019;s pervert ass around the block.&#x201d; I pushed a clump of hair that had strayed from the ponytail back from my face. &#x201c;Kicking isn&#x2019;t good enough. I think I&#x2019;ll shoot him.&#x201d; &#x201c;Go for it!&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Connie agreed. &#x201c;Shoot him.&#x201d; Lula checked out my clothes. &#x201c;You need a gun? I don&#x2019;t see no gun bulges in that spandex.&#x201d; She hiked up her T-shirt and pulled a Chief&#x2019;s Special out of her cut-off denim shorts. &#x201c;You could use mine. Just be careful; it sights high.&#x201d; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want a little peashooter like that,&#x201d; Connie said, opening her desk drawer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a forty-five. You can make a nice big hole with a forty-five.&#x201d; Lula went for her purse. &#x201c;Hold on here. If that&#x2019;s what you want, let me give you the big stud. I&#x2019;ve got a forty-four magnum loaded up with hydroshocks. This baby&#x2019;ll do <i>real</i> damage, you see what I&#x2019;m saying? You could drive a Volkswagen through the hole this sweetheart makes.&#x201d; &#x201c;I was sort of kidding about shooting him,&#x201d; I told them. &#x201c;Too bad,&#x201d; Connie said. Lula shoved her gun back in her shorts. &#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s damn disappointing.&#x201d; &#x201c;So where is he? Is he in?&#x201d; &#x201c;Hey, Vinnie!&#x201d; Connie yelled. &#x201c;Stephanie&#x2019;s here to see you!&#x201d; The door to the inner office opened and Vinnie poked his head out. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; Vinnie was 5&#x2019;7&#x201d;, looked like a weasel, thought like a weasel, smelled like a French whore and was once in love with a duck. &#x201c;You know what!&#x201d; I said, hands fisted on hips. &#x201c;Joyce Barnhardt, that&#x2019;s what. My grandma was at the beauty parlor and heard you hired Joyce to do skip tracing.&#x201d; &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the big deal? I hired Joyce Barnhardt.&#x201d; &#x201c;Joyce Barnhardt does makeovers at Macy&#x2019;s.&#x201d; &#x201c;And you used to sell ladies&#x2019; panties.&#x201d; &#x201c;That was entirely different. I blackmailed you into giving me this job.&#x201d; &#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; Vinnie said. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s your point?&#x201d; &#x201c;Fine!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;Just keep her out of my way! I <i>hate</i> Joyce Barnhardt!&#x201d; And everybody knew why. At the tender age of twenty-four, after less than a year of marriage, I&#x2019;d caught Joyce bare-assed on my dining room table, playing hide-the-salami with my husband. It was the only time she&#x2019;d ever done me a favor. We&#x2019;d gone through school together, where she&#x2019;d spread rumors, told fibs, ruined friendships and peeked under the stall doors in the girls&#x2019; bathroom to see people&#x2019;s underpants. She&#x2019;d been a fat kid with a terrible overbite. The overbite had been minimalized by braces, and by the time Joyce was fifteen she&#x2019;d trimmed down to look like Barbie on steroids. She had chemically enhanced red hair done up in big teased curls. Her nails were long and painted, her lips were high gloss, her eyes were rimmed in navy liquid liner, her lashes gunked up with blue-black mascara. She was an inch shorter than me, five pounds heavier and had me beat by two cup sizes. She had three ex-husbands and no children. It was rumored she had sex with large dogs. Joyce and Vinnie were a match made in heaven. Too bad Vinnie was already married to a perfectly nice woman whose father happened to be Harry the Hammer. Harry&#x2019;s job description read &#x201c;expediter,&#x201d; and Harry spent a lot of his time in the presence of men who wore fedoras and long black overcoats. &#x201c;Just do your job,&#x201d; Vinnie said. &#x201c;Be a professional.&#x201d; He waved his hand at Connie. &#x201c;Give her something. Give her that new skip we just got in.&#x201d; Connie took a manila folder from her desktop. &#x201c;Maxine Nowicki. Charged with stealing her former boyfriend&#x2019;s car. Posted bond with us and failed to show for her court appearance.&#x201d; By securing a cash bond Nowicki had been free to leave the lockup behind and return to society at large while awaiting trial. Now she&#x2019;d failed to appear. Or in bounty-hunter speak, she was FTA. This lapse of judicial etiquette changed Nowicki&#x2019;s status to felon and had my cousin Vinnie worrying that the court might see fit to keep his bond money. As a bond enforcement officer I was expected to find Nowicki and bring her back into the system. For performing this service in a timely manner I&#x2019;d get ten percent of her bond amount. Pretty good money since this sounded like a domestic dispute, and I didn&#x2019;t think Maxine Nowicki would be interested in blowing the back of my head off with a .45 hollow tip. I riffled through the paperwork, which consisted of Nowicki&#x2019;s bond agreement, a photo, and a copy of the police report. &#x201c;Know what I&#x2019;d do?&#x201d; Lula said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d talk to the boyfriend. Anybody pissed off enough to get his girlfriend arrested for stealing his car is pissed off enough to snitch on her. Probably he&#x2019;s just waiting to tell someone where to go find her.&#x201d; It was my thought too. I read aloud from Nowicki&#x2019;s charge sheet. &#x201c;Edward Kuntz. Single white male. Age twenty-seven. Residing at Seventeen Muffet Street. Says here he&#x2019;s a cook.&#x201d; <br> <br>I PARKED in front of Kuntz&#x2019;s house and wondered about the man inside. The house was white clapboard with aqua trim around the windows and tangerine paint on the door. It was half of a well-cared-for duplex with a minuscule front yard. A three-foot-tall statue of the Virgin Mary dressed in pale blue and white had been planted on the perfectly clipped patch of lawn. A carved wood heart with red lettering and little white daisies had been hung on the neighboring door, proclaiming that the Glicks lived there. The Kuntz side was free of ornamentation. I followed the sidewalk to the porch, which had been carpeted in green indoor-outdoor carpet, and rang the Kuntz doorbell. The door opened and a sweaty, muscle-bulging, half-naked man looked out at me. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; &#x201c;Eddie Kuntz?&#x201d; &#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; I passed him my business card. &#x201c;Stephanie Plum. I&#x2019;m a bond enforcement officer, and I&#x2019;m looking for Maxine Nowicki. I was hoping you could help me.&#x201d; &#x201c;You bet I can help you. She took my car. Can you believe it?&#x201d; He jerked his stubbled chin toward the curb. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s it right there. Lucky for her she didn&#x2019;t scratch it up. The cops picked her up driving through town in it, and they brought the car back to me.&#x201d; I glanced back at the car. A white Chevy Blazer. Freshly washed. I almost was tempted to steal it myself. &#x201c;You were living together?&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, yeah, for a while. About four months. And then we had this disagreement, and next thing I know, she&#x2019;s gone with my car. It wasn&#x2019;t that I wanted her arrested &#x2026; it was just that I wanted my car back. That was why I called the police. I wanted my car.&#x201d; &#x201c;Do you have any idea where she might be now?&#x201d; &#x201c;No. I tried to get in touch with her to sort of patch things up, but I couldn&#x2019;t find her. She quit her job at the diner and nobody&#x2019;s seen her. I stopped around her apartment a couple times, and there was never anybody home. I tried calling her mother. I called a couple of her girlfriends. No one seems to know anything. I guess they could have been lying to me, but I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d; He winked at me. &#x201c;Women don&#x2019;t lie to me, you know what I mean?&#x201d; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you mean.&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, I don&#x2019;t like to brag, but I have a way with women.&#x201d; &#x201c;Uh huh.&#x201d; It must have been the pungent aroma they found so attractive. Or maybe the overdeveloped, steroid-pumped muscles that made him look like he needed a bra. Or maybe it was the way he couldn&#x2019;t conduct a conversation without scratching his balls. &#x201c;So what can I do for you?&#x201d; Kuntz asked. Half an hour later I left with a list of Maxine&#x2019;s friends and relatives. I knew where Maxine banked, bought her booze, shopped for groceries, dry-cleaned her clothes and had her hair done. Kuntz promised to call me if he heard from Maxine, and I&#x2019;d promised to reciprocate in kind if I turned up anything interesting. Of course, I&#x2019;d had my fingers crossed when I&#x2019;d made the promise. I suspected Eddie Kuntz&#x2019;s way with women was to make them run screaming in the opposite direction. He stood on the porch and watched me angle into my car. &#x201c;Cute,&#x201d; he called. &#x201c;I like when a chick drives a sporty little car.&#x201d; I sent him a smile that felt a lot like a grimace and peeled away from the curb. I&#x2019;d gotten the CRX in February, sucked in by a shiny new paint job and an odometer that read 12,000 miles. Cherry condition, the owner had said. Hardly ever driven. And that was partly true. It was hardly ever driven with the odometer cable connected. Not that it mattered. The price had been right, and I looked good in the driver&#x2019;s seat. I&#x2019;d recently developed a dime-sized lesion on my exhaust pipe, but if I played Metallica loud enough I could hardly hear the muffler noise. I might have thought twice about buying the car if I&#x2019;d known Eddie Kuntz thought it was cute. My first stop was the Silver Dollar Diner. Maxine had worked there for seven years and had listed no other source of income. The Silver Dollar was open twenty-four hours. It served good food in generous portions and was always packed with overweight people and penny-pinching seniors. The families of fatties cleaned their plates, and the seniors took leftovers home in doggy bags &#x2026; butter pats, baskets of rolls, packets of sugar, half-eaten pieces of deep-fried haddock, coleslaw, fruit cup, grease-logged french fries. A senior could eat for three days off one meal at the Silver Dollar. The Silver Dollar was in Hamilton Township on a stretch of road that was clogged with discount stores and small strip malls. It was almost noon, and diner patrons were scarfing down burgers and BLTs. I introduced myself to the woman behind the register and asked about Maxine. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe she&#x2019;s in all this trouble,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;Maxine was responsible. Real dependable.&#x201d; She straightened a stack of menus. &#x201c;And that business about the car!&#x201d; She did some eye rolling. &#x201c;Maxine drove it to work lots of times. He gave her the keys. And then all of a sudden she&#x2019;s arrested for stealing.&#x201d; She gave a grunt of disgust. &#x201c;Men!&#x201d; I stepped back to allow a couple to pay their bill. When they&#x2019;d pocketed their complimentary mints, matchbooks and toothpicks and exited the diner I turned back to the cashier. &#x201c;Maxine failed to show for her court appearance. Did she give any indication that she might be leaving town?&#x201d; &#x201c;She said she was going on vacation, and we all thought she was due. Been working here for seven years and never once took a vacation.&#x201d; &#x201c;Has anyone heard from her since she&#x2019;s left?&#x201d; &#x201c;Not that I know of. Maybe Margie. Maxine and Margie always worked the same shift. Four to ten. If you want to talk to Margie you should come back around eight. We get real busy with the early-bird specials at four, but then around eight it starts to slack off.&#x201d; I thanked the woman and went back to my CRX. My next stop would be Nowicki&#x2019;s apartment. According to Kuntz, Nowicki had lived with him for four months but had never gotten around to moving out of her place. The apartment was a quarter mile from the diner, and Nowicki had stated on her bond agreement that she&#x2019;d resided there for six years. All previous addresses were local. Maxine Nowicki was Trenton clear to the roots of her bleached blond hair. The apartment was in a complex of two-story, blocky, red-brick buildings anchored in islands of parched grass, arranged around macadam parking lots. Nowicki was on the second floor with a first-floor entrance. Inside private stairwell. Not good for window snooping. All second-floor apartments had small balconies on the back side, but I&#x2019;d need a ladder to get to the balcony. Probably a woman climbing up a ladder would look suspicious. I decided to go with the obvious and knock on the door. If no one answered I&#x2019;d ask the super to let me in. Many times the super was cooperative in this way, especially if he was confused as to the authenticity of my fake badge. There were two front doors side by side. One was for upstairs and one was for downstairs. The name under the upstairs doorbell read Nowicki. The name under the downstairs doorbell read Pease. I rang the upstairs doorbell and the downstairs door opened and an elderly woman looked out at me. &#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t home.&#x201d; &#x201c;Are you Mrs. Pease?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; &#x201c;Are you sure Maxine isn&#x2019;t home?&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, I guess I&#x2019;d know. You can hear everything in this cheapskate apartment. If she was home I&#x2019;d hear her TV. I&#x2019;d hear her walking around. And besides, she&#x2019;d stop in to tell me she was home and collect her mail.&#x201d; Ah hah! The woman was collecting Maxine&#x2019;s mail. Maybe she also had Maxine&#x2019;s key. &#x201c;Yes, but suppose she came home late one night and didn&#x2019;t want to wake you?&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And then suppose she had a stroke?&#x201d; &#x201c;I never thought of that.&#x201d; &#x201c;She could be upstairs right now, gasping her last breath of air.&#x201d; The woman rolled her eyes upward, as if she could see through walls. &#x201c;Hmmm.&#x201d; &#x201c;Do you have a key?&#x201d; &#x201c;Well, yes &#x2026;&#x201d; &#x201c;And what about her plants? Have you been watering her plants?&#x201d; &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t ask me to water her plants.&#x201d; &#x201c;Maybe we should go take a look. Make sure everything is okay.&#x201d; &#x201c;Are you a friend of Maxine&#x2019;s?&#x201d; I held up two fingers side by side. &#x201c;Like this.&#x201d; &#x201c;I suppose it wouldn&#x2019;t hurt to check. I&#x2019;ll be right back with the key. I&#x2019;ve got it in the kitchen.&#x201d; Okay, so I fibbed a little. But it wasn&#x2019;t such a bad fib because it was for a good cause. And besides, she <i>could</i> be dead in her bed. And her plants <i>could</i> be dying of thirst. &#x201c;Here it is,&#x201d; Mrs. Pease said, brandishing the key. She turned the key in the lock and pushed the door open. &#x201c;Hell- <i>oo</i>-o,&#x201d; she called in her warbling old lady&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;Anybody home?&#x201d; No one answered, so we crept up the stairs. We stood in the little entrance area and looked into the living room&#x2014;dining room. &#x201c;Not much of a housekeeper,&#x201d; Mrs. Pease said. Housekeeping had nothing to do with it. The apartment had been trashed. It wasn&#x2019;t a fight because nothing was smashed. And it wasn&#x2019;t clutter from a last-minute scurry to leave. Cushions were pulled off the couch and flung onto the floor. Cupboard doors were open. Drawers were pulled from the hutch and turned upside down, contents spilled out. I did a quick walk-through and saw more of the same in the bedroom and bath. Someone had been looking for something. Money? Drugs? If it was robbery it had been very specific, because the TV and VCR were untouched. &#x201c;Someone has ransacked this apartment,&#x201d; I said to Mrs. Pease. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you didn&#x2019;t hear the ...</p><h2>A Gathering of Spies</h2><p>A British agent with divided loyalties is sent to stop a female spy who is headed back to Germany with stolen atomic secrets. 75,000 first prnting.</p><p>In his debut novel, <i>A Gathering of Spies</i>, John Altman delivers an old-fashioned page-turner, energetically told. Katarina Heinrich is a beautiful Nazi spy living in deep cover as the wife of a Princeton professor. When her husband is hired to help develop the atomic bomb in Los Alamos, Catherine, as she is known, uncovers the secret and resolves to carry it to Germany at all costs. <p> <i>A Gathering of Spies</i> fuses the plots of Katarina and a British double agent, Winterbotham, whose wife is incarcerated in a Polish prison camp. Winterbotham believes he will do anything to obtain her freedom. Does that include trading the Allies' greatest secrets? In an exciting role reversal, Katarina is the superhuman agent capable of storming a British stronghold and retrieving a high-ranking German prisoner. Winterbotham, by contrast, is cerebral and unknown even to himself. His secret plots are revealed subtly.</p><p> If there is a flaw in <i>A Gathering of Spies</i>, it is that Altman's plots get too intertwined. You might find yourself having to reread passages to get the buried implications. But Altman never commits the cardinal sin of obscuring important clues only to illuminate them in the last pages for the <i>aha!</i> conclusion. <i>A Gathering of Spies</i> represents titans like Einstein, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Hitler with casual confidence--there to remind us that the stakes of this mystery are nothing less than the fate of the world. <i>--Kathi Inman Berens</i></p>John Altman is a musician and a freelance writer in New York City.

Hundreds of thousands of people took heed, joining religious cults and anti-governmental militias in preparation for the coming war between good and evil. (If this sounds familiar, it is proof only that history is cyclical.) During this heady time, Europe exploded in religious war, peasant revolts and sectarian strife, marked by the first large-scale massacres of Jews and gypsies, the first inklings of inquisitions and holy crusades. Norman Cohn, a masterful writer and interpreter, carefully explores this extraordinary period in European history in a book that bears rereading as our own millennium approaches its end.This fascinating book explores the millenarianism that flourished in Western Europe between the eleventh and sixteenth centuries.</p><h2>Forever Ours: Real Stories of Immortality and Living from a Forensic Pathologist</h2><p>Forensic pathologist Janis Amatuzio first began recording the stories told to her by patients, police officers, and other doctors because she felt that no one spoke for the dead. She believed the real experience of death - namely, the spiritual and otherworldly experiences of those near death and their loved ones - was ignored by the medical professionals, who thought of death as simply the cessation of breath. She knew there was more. From the first experience of a patient in her care dying to the miraculous &#34;appearances&#34; of loved ones after death, she began recording these experiences, knowing that they would bring comfort to anyone who has suffered the loss of someone they love. Written by a scientist in approachable, nonjudgmental language for anyone who has lost someone they love, this book offers stories that can&#39;t be explained in purely physical terms.</p><p>"A deeply compassionate, extraordinarily sensitive, and objectively scientific exploration of the mystery of death, this book is a wonderful gift."<br> -- <b>Neale Donald Walsch,</b> author of <i>Conversations with God</i> <br><br> "Here is a doctor with a heart.

Her vision is a stark contrast to the dismal pronouncements of modern science that death is the end of everything. <i>Forever Ours</i> is the only book I know that finds buoyant, optimistic meaning in the morgue.

Joffe&#x2019;s well-documented research confirms an entirely different story: that the United States stands near or at the top of every ranking used to measure a nation&#x2019;s strength and vigor. It is a book that should be of interest to all who may be worried about America&#x2019;s future.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Henry A.

It is the best book on the subject in years.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Fareed Zakaria, author of <em>The Future of Freedom</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Joseph Joffe has written a bracing and intelligent reminder that, for all its woes, America remains extraordinarily dynamic, innovative and resilient.

Joffe&#x2019;s detailed catalogue of economic and civil weaknesses in the Chinese police state is the book&#x2019;s high point, however, with the author observing that repression has been the Chinese way since the Ming Dynasty.... For readers tired of blame-America-first critics or who want to find out what a smart, influential European thinks of the country&#x2019;s prospects, Joffe&#x2019;s book is a useful place to begin.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A solid...job of refuting the declinism so feared by the right and perhaps welcomed by some even farther to the right and left. Along the way, Joffe cites some little-discussed statistics, such as the fact that China&#x2019;s aging population and the need for a replenished labor pool to support it fall into &#x2018;ratios [that] are far worse than any in the West.&#x2019; So much for China as the rising dominant world power. There is no triumphalism here, for Joffe notes that there are plenty of problems for the United States to overcome, such as &#x2018;the breakdown of bipartisanship...intractable deficits and rising debt...[and] social polarization.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;German intellectual Josef Joffe makes a stirring case against the Fareed Zakaria and Thomas Friedman&#x2019;s of the world that America is strong and getting stronger.... While acknowledging that anything is possible and America&#x2019;s best days may yet be behind us, Joffe is adept at explaining the intangible factors that will likely ensure America&#x2019;s preeminence for ages to come.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Kirchick, <em>The Daily Beast</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Brave and bracing.... Joffe makes a strong case that a mix of Chinese vulnerabilities and American strengths means it is unlikely that China will replace the United States anytime soon as the center of the global system. Yet, as Joffe notes, constant anxiety about the United States&#x2019; prospects might be one of the cultural forces responsible for the country&#x2019;s persistent strength; rather than resting on their laurels, Americans continually and even neurotically poke at their social fabric, looking for tears that need mending.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Walter Russell Mead, <em>Foreign Affairs</em></strong></p><h2>Kudos: A Novel</h2><p><p>Rachel Cusk, the award-winning and critically acclaimed author of&nbsp;<em>Outline&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Transit</em>, completes the transcendent literary trilogy with Kudos, a novel of unsettling power.</p><p>A woman writer visits a Europe in flux, where questions of personal and political identity are rising to the surface and the trauma of change is opening up new possibilities of loss and renewal.

For every smashing success (Frank Miller&#x2019;s Dark Knight Returns, 1986; Mark Waid&#x2019;s Kingdom Come, 1996), there are many silly, commercially driven failures. Hine, who has been in the business since 1980 with popular characters such as the X-Men and the Teen Titans, and his collaborator, Sapolsky, score a resounding success here. The first of Marvel&#x2019;s new Noir line, which places familiar heroes into pulp-inspired 1930s narratives, throws young Peter Parker into a world of gangster-run streets and crusading newspapermen, as the young man steps into the role of a fearsome vigilante in the tradition of the Shadow. Even as the story spins familiar characters and motivations in a slightly different direction and melds the pulp sensibility with an accurate and detailed historical depiction, Di Giandomenico&#x2019;s art displays a fluid depth and is drenched in shadow, creating an atmosphere entirely appropriate to noir. Along with a surprising complexity in supporting characters like Aunt May and Ben Urich (here a heroin addict) comes a moral shading that will offer older readers something to chew on, though rest assured that the heroic themes of integrity, courage, redemption, and idealism come through loud and clear. Features fun, illuminating bonus materials, too.

Halivni, professor of religion at Columbia University and author of the nine-volume commentary Sources and Traditions, grew up in the town of Sighet in the Carpathian Mountains, the same village where Elie Wiesel, a close friend, was raised. He was recognized quite early as an ilui, a talmudic prodigy. Halivni recalls how his inexhaustible love for and commitment to the Talmud, his ``bastion,'' kept him alive and sane through his separation from his parents, Auschwitz and the Gross Rosen concentration camps, and some indigent early years in America. Halivni clearly explicates his approach to the Talmud, noting how he balances ``critical'' study (non-literalist, influenced by philology and history) with a very traditionalist practice of halacha (Jewish law and observance). He explains the disagreement over the latter that drove him to resign from the Conservative movement's Jewish Theological Seminary, his home for three decades. In his eloquent resignation letter, reprinted here in full and alone worth the book's price, Halivni also writes movingly of his struggle for faith after the Holocaust, observing that ``true love is tormented love . . . The task is to reach out to heaven when it is cloudy, when heaven is no longer visible.'' The memoir is often dry, and too reticent about Halivni's life in America (his wife and sons are mentioned only twice in passing), but it is laced with more than enough moving meditations on faith and the life of a devoted student of religion to make it of considerable interest to an audience far larger than the relatively small universe of Judaica scholars. A great scholar, Halivni has not written a great memoir, but he has produced a quite good one, succinct, intellectually illuminating, and sometimes surprisingly poignant. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

During the Cretan revolt of 1897 his family was sent to the island of Naxos, where he attended the French School of the Holy Cross. From 1902 to 1906 he studied law at Athens University. He worked first as a journalist and throughout a long career wrote several plays, travel journals and translations. His remarkable travels began in 1907 and there were few countries in Europe or Asia that he didn't visit. He studied Buddhism in Vienna and later belonged to a group of radical intellectuals in Berlin, where he began his great epic <b>The Odyssey</b>, which he completed in 1938.

Jackson, his adored wife Zee, their toddler Joshua, and newborn daughter Diana. For others, the picturesque vacation spot is a relaxing escape from a world filled with trouble.

Their arrival has incurred the wrath of a pair of local gangsters, and a deadly stalker from out of the young ladies&#39; past has found out where they are hiding. Twin hurricanes are about to slam the idyllic island -- one a natural climatic disaster, the other an all-too-human catastrophe -- and it looks as if J.W. is going to get caught in the middle. And since his conscience won&#39;t allow him to abandon two frightened, helpless visitors to the fury of the coming storm, he stows away his fishing gear, sends his loved ones off-island...and dives headfirst into the tempest.<b>Philip R.

While her parents and two older sisters were taken to the gas chambers, she and her twin, Miriam, were herded into the care of the man known as the Angel of Death, Dr. Josef Mengele. Subjected to sadistic medical experiments, she was forced to fight daily for her and her twin&#39;s survival. In this incredible true story written for young adults, readers learn of a child&#39;s endurance and survival in the face of truly extraordinary evil. The book also includes an epilogue on Eva&#39;s recovery from this experience and her remarkable decision to publicly forgive the Nazis. Through her museum and her lectures, she has dedicated her life to giving testimony on the Holocaust, providing a message of hope for people who have suffered, and working for causes of human rights and peace.</p><p>Eva Mozes Kor is a resident of Terre Haute, IN. She is a recognized speaker, both nationally and internationally, on topics related to the Holocaust and social justice. Eva created the CANDLES organization in 1985 to locate other Mengele twins and found 122 twins throughout the world. She then opened the CANDLES Holocaust Museum in 1995 to educate the public about the historic event she survived. A community leader, champion of human rights, and tireless educator, Eva has been covered in numerous media outlets and is the subject of a documentary, Eva A-7063.<br><br>Lisa Rojany Buccieri has written over 100 children&#x2019;s books, including several award-winning and bestselling titles. She is also a publishing executive and editor with over 20 years of experience in the industry. Lisa lives with her family in Los Angeles.Grade 6 Up&#x2014;Kor relates memories of life in the village of Portz, Transylvania (Romania), where she was raised on a large farm, "never aware of the anti-Semitism [that pervaded the country] until 1940, when the Hungarian army came." Six-year-old Eva and her identical twin, Miriam, the only Jewish children in their small mixed-grade classroom, suddenly found themselves taunted and beaten by once-friendly classmates. At 10 years of age, the twins and their family were forced to live among seven thousand other Jews in a fenced-in field, protected from the elements only by tents made of their own blankets and sheets and by the clothes on their backs. They were soon taken on a four-day train ride to Auschwitz, standing all the way, with no food or drink. There the sisters were "selected" to be victims of Dr. Josef Mengele's medical "research." Eva's amazing fortitude and her desire to protect her sister helped her to survive a horrible disease brought on by an injection. Both twins endured a terrifying daylong separation during a forced march between camps; the remaining Auschwitz prisoners were liberated by Soviet soldiers, and the girls found a way to go home in search of family survivors. Kor's straightforward first-person narrative is unusual because it details life in the concentration camp through the eyes of a child who lived among children. In an eight-page epilogue, the author talks about her discovery, 50 years after liberation, of the importance of forgiveness ("a seed for peace"), and of what she has done to teach young people the positive lessons of life garnered from her horrific experiences.&#x2014;<i>Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

It is the successful companion reader for the Rachels text, THE ELEMENTS OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY. This anthology explores further the theories and issues introduced in that volume, in their original and classic formulations. The collection can stand on its own as the text for a course in moral philosophy, or it can be used to supplement any introductory text. The reader begins with two essays by Rachels which provide a short introduction to moral philosophy and some basic points about arguments. Part I consists of classic and contemporary readings about the nature of morality and Part II provides contemporary essays on current moral issues. Fourteen of the 28 readings are new in the second edition (Readings 2, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18, 20, 21,22, 23, 24, 25, and 28).</p><p>James Rachels, the distinguished American moral philosopher, was born in Columbus, Georgia, graduating from Mercer University in Macon in 1962. He received his Ph.D. in 1967 from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He taught at the University of Richmond, New York University, the University of Miami, Duke University, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where he spent the last twenty-six years of his career. 1971 saw the publication of Rachels&#x2019; groundbreaking textbook Moral Problems, which ignited the movement in America away from teaching ethical theory towards teaching concrete practical issues. Moral Problems sold 100,000 copies over three editions. In 1975, Rachels wrote &#x201c;Active and Passive Euthanasia,&#x201d; arguing that the distinction so important in the law between killing and letting die has no rational basis. Originally appearing in the New England Journal of Medicine, this essay has been reprinted roughly 300 times and is a staple of undergraduate education. The End of Life (1986) was about the morality of killing and the value of life. Created from Animals (1990) argued that a Darwinian world-view has widespread philosophical implications, including drastic implications for our treatment of nonhuman animals. Can Ethics Provide Answers? (1997) was Rachels&#x2019; first collection of papers (others are expected posthumously). Rachels&#x2019; McGraw-Hill textbook, The Elements of Moral Philosophy, is now in its fourth edition and is easily the best-selling book of its kind. Over his career, Rachels wrote 5 books and 85 essays, edited 7 books and gave about 275 professional lectures. His work has been translated into Dutch, Italian, Japanese, and Serbo-Croatian. James Rachels is widely admired as a stylist, as his prose is remarkably free of jargon and clutter. A major theme in his work is that reason can resolve difficult moral issues. He has given reasons for moral vegetarianism and animal rights, for affirmative action (including quotas), for the humanitarian use of euthanasia, and for the idea that parents owe as much moral consideration to other people&#x2019;s children as they do to their own. James Rachels died of cancer on September 5th, 2003, in Birmingham, Alabama.</p><h2>How to Draw Manga: Male Characters</h2><p>Explains, and provides examples on, how to draw manga style men and boys.</p><p></p><h2>Kubrick: The Definitive Edition</h2><p>With a new Introduction by Martin Scorsese.<br><br>If Stanley Kubrick had made only<i> 2001: A Space Odyssey</i> or <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, his cinematic legacy would have been assured.

Maxwell Whyte vividly describes his experiences with the demon oppressed and the demon possessed. He gives fascinating information on how to recognize the power of the Devil.

A. Maxwell Whyte (1908&#x2013;1988) embarked on a journey in ministry that was fraught with uncertainty and an absence of familiar landmarks when he was sovereignly led by the Holy Spirit into an understanding of demonic activity and spiritual warfare. As is so often the case with pioneers, he was misunderstood, ridiculed, and ostracized by the Christian community, even in his own city of Toronto. Despite great opposition, he forged ahead in the battle against the forces of Satan, convinced that the ministry of deliverance was scripturally based and was being restored to the church. Later, he began to record his experiences, and over the next two&#x2013;and&#x2013;a&#x2013;half decades, he authored eighteen books. His first book, The Power of the Blood, has been translated into several languages and is widely distributed throughout the world, selling over 500,000 copies internationally.<br></p><h2>Big Sky Country (The Parable Series, 1)</h2><p><br><br>The illegitimate son of a wealthy rancher, Sheriff Slade Barlow grew up in a trailer hitched to the Curly-Burly hair salon his mother runs.

Linda exploresthat turbulent time in <i>The Yankee Widow.</i><i>Parable, Montana</i><br><br>"You weren't at the funeral," Slade Barlow's half brother, Hutch Carmody, accused, the words rasping against the underside of a long, slow exhale.<br><br>Slade didn't look at Hutch, though he could still see him out of the corner of one eye. The both of them were sitting side by side in a pair of uncomfortable chairs, facing what seemed like an acre of desk. Maggie Landers, their father's lawyer, who had summoned them there, had yet to put in an appearance.<br><br>"I went to the graveside service," Slade replied evenly, and after a considerable length. It was the truth, though he'd stood at some distance from the crowd, not wanting to be numbered among the admitted mourners but unable to stay away entirely.<br><br>"Why bother at all?" Hutch challenged. "Unless you just wanted to make sure the old man was really in the box?"<br><br>Slade was not a quick-tempered man&#x2014;by nature, he tended to think before he spoke and offer whatever response he might make with quiet deliberation, traits that had served him well over the several years since he'd been elected sheriff&#x2014;but the edge in his half brother's tone brought heat surging up his neck to pound behind his ears.<br><br>"Maybe that was it," he drawled with quiet contempt as the office door whispered open behind them.<br><br>Hutch, who had just shoved back his chair as if to leap to his feet, ready to fight, thrust a hand hard through his shock of brownish-blond hair instead, probably to discharge that rush of adrenaline, and stayed put. He all but buzzed, like an electric fence line short-circuiting in a thunderstorm.<br><br>Slade, though still confounded by his own invitation to this particular shindig, took a certain grim satisfaction in Hutch's reaction. There was, as the old saying went, no love lost between the two of them.<br><br>"Good to see you haven't killed each other," Maggie observed brightly, rounding the shining expanse of the desk to take the leather chair behind it. Still gorgeous at fifty-plus, with short, expertly dyed brown hair and round green eyes, usually alight with mischievous intelligence, the lawyer turned slightly to boot up her computer.<br><br>"Not just yet, anyhow," Hutch replied finally.<br><br>Maggie's profile was all he could see of her, but Slade registered the slight smile that tilted up one corner of her mouth. Her fingers, perfectly manicured every Saturday morning at his mother's beauty shop for the last quarter of a century, flicked busily over the keyboard, and the monitor threw a wash of pale blue light onto her face and the lightweight jacket of her custom-made off-white pantsuit.<br><br>"How's your mother, Slade?" she asked mildly without glancing his way.<br><br>Maggie and his mom, Callie, were around the same age, and they'd been friends for as long as Slade could remember. Given that he'd run into Maggie at his mom's Curly-Burly Hair Salon just the day before, where she'd been having a trim and a touch-up, he figured the question was a rhetorical one, a sort of conversational filler.<br><br>"She's fine," Slade said. By then, he'd gotten over the urge to commit fratricide and gone back to mulling the thing that had been bothering him ever since the formidable Ms. Landers had called him at home that morning and asked him to stop by her office on his way to work.<br><br>The meeting had to be about the old man's last will and testament, though Maggie hadn't said so over the phone. All she'd been willing to give up was, "This won't take long, Slade, and believe me, it's in your best interests to be there."<br><br>Hutch's presence made sense, since he was the legitimate son, the golden boy, groomed since birth to become the master of all he surveyed even as, motherless from the age of twelve, he ran wild. Slade himself, on the other hand, was the outsider&#x2014;born on the proverbial wrong side of the blanket.<br><br>John Carmody had never once acknowledged him, in all Slade's thirty-five years of life, and it wasn't likely that he'd had a deathbed change of heart and altered his will to include the product of his long-ago affair with Callie.<br><br>No, Slade thought, Carmody hadn't <i>had</i> a heart, not where he and his mother were concerned, anyway. He'd never so much as spoken to Slade in all those years; looked right through him, when they did come into contact, as if he was invisible. If that stiff-necked son of a bitch had instructed Maggie to make sure Slade was there for the reading of the will, it was probably so he'd know what he was missing out on, when all that land and money went to Hutch.<br><br><i>You can stick it all where the sun never shines, old man,</i> Slade thought angrily. He'd never expected&#x2014;or wanted&#x2014;to inherit a damn thing from John Carmody&#x2014;bad enough that he'd gotten the bastard's looks, his dark hair, lean and muscular build, and blue eyes&#x2014;and it galled him that Maggie, his mother's friend, would be a party to wasting his time like this.<br><br>Maggie clicked the mouse, and her printer began spewing sheets of paper as she turned to face Hutch and Slade head-on.<br><br>"I'll spare you all the legal jargon," she said, gathering the papers from the printer tray, separating them into two piles and shoving these across the top of her desk, one set for each of them. "All the facts are there&#x2014;you can read the wills over at your leisure."<br><br>Slade barely glanced at the documents and made no move to pick them up.<br><br>"And what facts are those?" Hutch snapped, peevish.<br><br><i>Pecker-head,</i> Slade thought.<br><br>Maggie interlaced her fingers and smiled benignly. It took more than a smart-ass cowboy to get under her hide. "The estate is to be divided equally between the two of you," she announced.<br><br>Stunned, Slade simply sat there, as breathless as if he'd just taken a sucker punch to the gut. A single thought hummed in his head, like a trapped moth trying to find a way out.<br><br><i>What the</i> hell?<br><br>Hutch, no doubt just as shocked as Slade was, if not more so, leaned forward and growled, <i>"What</i> did you say?"<br><br>"You heard me the first time, Hutch," Maggie said, unruffled. She might have looked like a gracefully aging pixie, but she regularly chewed up the best prosecutors in the state and spit them out like husks of sunflower seeds.<br><br>Slade said nothing. He was still trying to process the news.<br><br>"Bullshit," Hutch muttered. "This is <i>bullshit.7''</i><br><br>Maggie sighed. "Nevertheless," she said, "it's what Mr. Carmody wanted. He was my client, and it's my job to see that his final wishes are honored to the letter. After all, Whisper Creek belonged to him, and he had every right to dispose of his estate however he saw fit."<br><br>Slade finally recovered enough equanimity to speak, though his voice came out sounding hoarse. "What if I told you I didn't want anything?" he demanded.<br><br>"If you told me that," Maggie responded smoothly, "I'd say you were out of your mind, Slade Barlow. We're talking about a great deal of money here, in addition to a very profitable ranching operation and all that goes with it, including buildings and livestock and mineral rights."<br><br>Another silence descended, short and dangerous, pulsing with heat.<br><br>Hutch was the one to break it. "When did Dad change his will?" he asked.<br><br>"He <i>didn't</i> change it," Maggie said without hesitation. "Mr. Carmody had the papers drawn up years ago, when my father and grandfather were still with the firm, and he personally reviewed them six months ago, after he got the diagnosis. <i>This is what he wanted,</i> Hutch."<br><br>Hutch snapped up his copy of the document and got to his feet. Slade rose, too, but he left the papers where they were. None of this seemed real to him&#x2014;he was probably dreaming. Any moment now, he'd wake up in a cold sweat and a tangle of sheets, in his lonely, rumpled bed over at the duplex where he'd been living since he came back to Parable ten years ago, after college, a stint in the military and a brief marriage followed by a mostly amicable divorce.<br><br>"I'll be <i>damned"</i> Hutch muttered, his voice like sandpaper. He was dressed for ranch work, in old jeans, a blue cotton shirt and a pair of well-worn boots, which probably meant he'd had no more notice about this meeting than Slade had.<br><br>"Thanks, Maggie," Slade heard himself say as he turned to leave.<br><br>He wasn't grateful; he'd spoken out of habit.<br><br>She got up from her chair, rounded the desk and pursued him, forcing the printout of his father's will into his hands. "At least read it," she said. "I'll set up another meeting in a few days, when you've both had time to absorb everything."<br><br>Slade didn't answer, but he accepted the paperwork, felt it crumple in his grasp as his fingers tightened re-flexively around it.<br><br>Moments later, as Slade opened the door of his truck, Hutch was beside him again.<br><br>"I'll buy your half of the ranch," he said, grinding out the offer. "I don't give a rat's ass about the money&#x2014; I've got plenty of that anyway&#x2014;but Whisper Creek has been in my family for almost a hundred years, and my great-great-grandfather built the original house and barn with his own hands. The place ought to belong to me outright."<br><br>The emphasis on the phrase <i>my family</i> was subtle, but it was an unmistakable line in the sand.<br><br>Slade met his half brother's fierce gaze. Reached in to take his hat off the passenger seat where he'd left it earlier, resting on its crown, before heading into Maggie's office. "I'll need to give that some thought," he said.<br><br>With a visible effort, Hutch unclamped the hinges of his jaws. "What's there to think about?" he asked, after another crackling pause. "I'll pay cash, Barlow. Name your price."<br><br><i>Name your price.</i> Slade knew he ought to accept the deal, and just be glad John Carmody had seen fit to claim him, albeit posthumously. All he had to do was say yes, and he could buy that little spread he'd had his eye on for the past couple of years, pay cash for it, instead of depleting his savings for the down payment. But something prevented him from agreeing, something that ran deeper than his utter inability to act on impulse.<br><br>Indirectly, John Carmody had, at long last, acknowledged his existence. He needed to be with that knowledge for a while, work out what it meant, if anything.<br><br>"I'll get back to you," Slade finally reiterated, climbing up behind the wheel of his truck and putting on his hat. "In the meantime, I've got a county to look after."<br><br>With that, he shut the truck door.<br><br>Hutch thumped the metal hard with the heel of one palm, then turned and stormed away, rounded the hood of the Whisper Creek pickup, yanked open the door and jumped into the driver's seat.<br><br>Slade watched as the other man ground the engine to life, shoved it into Reverse and threw some gravel in the process. He was all sound and fury, though. Half again too smart to actually break the speed limit with the sheriff looking on.<br><br>With a wry twist to his mouth, Slade waited a few moments, started his own rig and pulled onto the narrow side street. He was supposed to be in his office over at the courthouse, assigning his day shift deputies to patrol various parts of the county, but he headed for the highway instead. Five minutes later, he pulled up in front of his mother's place, an old trailer with rust-speckled aluminum skirting and a plywood addition that served as living quarters.<br><br>As a kid, Slade had been about half-ashamed of that jumble of metal and wood, jerry-rigged together the way it was, lacking only waist-high weeds, a few rattletrap cars up on blocks and household appliances on the porch to qualify as out-and-out redneck. Callie nagged him into power-washing the two-toned walls of the trailer&#x2014;the part that housed the shop&#x2014;at least twice a year, and he painted the rest of it regularly, too.<br><br>This week, all the words on the dusty reader-board at the edge of the gravel parking lot were even spelled correctly. <i>Acrylic nails, half price. Highlights/perms, ten percent off.</i><br><br>Slade smiled as he shut off the truck and got out.<br><br>The shop didn't open for business until ten o'clock, but Callie already had the lights on, and, most likely, the big coffeepot was chugging away, too. As Slade approached, the door opened, and Callie, broom in hand, beamed a greeting.<br><br>"Hey," she called.<br><br>"Hey," Slade replied gruffly.<br><br>Callie Barlow was a small woman, big-busted, with an abundance of auburn hair held to the top of her head by a plastic clasp roughly the size of the jaws-of-life, and she wore turquoise jeans, pink Western boots and a bright yellow T-shirt studded with little sparkly things.<br><br>"Well, this is a surprise," she said, setting aside the broom and dusting her hands together. Her expression was warm, as always, but her gray eyes showed puzzlement bordering on concern. She knew Slade took his job seriously, and it wasn't like him to drop in during working hours. "Is the county running itself these days?"<br><br>"My deputies are holding down the fort," Slade answered. "Is the coffee on?"<br><br>He knew it was; he could smell the rich aroma wafting through the open doorway, along with tinges of industrial-strength shampoo and a variety of mysterious hair-bending chemicals.<br><br>"Sure," Callie responded, stepping back so he could come inside the shop.

Glatthaar </b>is the author of six books and teaches history at the<br>University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.<br><b></b><br><b>James Kirby Martin </b>is the author of eleven books and teaches history at the University of Houston.<br><br><b>Prologue</b>:<br>&nbsp;<br>THE REVOLUTION&#x2019;S<br>JUBILEE, THE MARQUIS DE LAFAYETTE,<br>AND SELECTIVE HISTORICAL MEMORY<br>&nbsp;<br>Not yet twenty years old, the Marquis de Lafayette, a starry-eyed member of the French nobility who had volunteered his services for the rebel cause, sailed to North America for the first time in 1777. For this young idealist, the American Revolution represented an opportunity to strike a blow for human liberty, fulfill his desire for personal glory, and secure a measure of revenge against his nation&#x2019;s archrival, Great Britain. The Continental Congress, after much wrangling, had commissioned him a major general, hoping this appointment would further strengthen ties with France and become another reason for that nation to join the rebellious American patriots in a formal military alliance.<br>&nbsp;<br>George Washington took an instant liking to Lafayette, whose full name was Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier. Despite Lafayette&#x2019;s youth and inexperience, Washington came to respect his abilities and soon entrusted him with important command responsibilities. Some of these assignments brought Lafayette into contact with members of the Oneida Indian nation, who were also informally allied with and fighting on the side of the American rebels.<br>&nbsp;<br>In January 1824, nearly forty-one years after the American Revolution officially ended, President James Monroe invited Lafayette to return to his second home, the nation he had helped forge. As part of a number of fiftieth anniversary&#x2013;related activities, the president, an aging Revolutionary War veteran himself, believed that Lafayette and the peoples of the United States should have one last opportunity to see each other before the ever-relentless sands of time completely swept away the hallowed Revolutionary generation.1<br>&nbsp;<br>Always garrulous and charming in his persona but with a tincture of vanity thrown in, Lafayette gladly accepted Monroe&#x2019;s invitation. With a small coterie of traveling companions, including his son, George Washington Motier de Lafayette, the marquis arrived in New York City in mid-August 1824 and began a tour that took him through all twenty-four states before he sailed home to France in September 1825.<br>&nbsp;<br>Everywhere Lafayette went, large, enthusiastic crowds welcomed him. On his first day in New York City, some thirty thousand people turned out to see the aging hero. So it was at all his appearances. Crowds cheered him, politicians coddled him, old friends hugged and cried with him. Three former presidents whom he had known long ago&#x2014;John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison&#x2014;hosted him. Congress voted him the lavish sum of two hundred thousand dollars to recognize his personal sacrifices in fighting to secure America&#x2019;s liberty and independence.2<br>&nbsp;<br>Once more, it seemed, Lafayette had arrived when the American people needed him. Divisive politics, especially over slavery, were pulling the young American nation apart. As the last living Continental Army major general, Lafayette allowed citizens north and south to put their differences aside, even if only for a few moments, and harken back to what some viewed as more purposeful times. In that spirit of selective nostalgia, the marquis&#x2019;s tour became a celebration of what the young republic had managed to accomplish, of the sacrifices of Lafayette and his comrades in arms.3<br>&nbsp;<br>For the people of Utica, New York, and other towns in the western Mohawk Valley, Lafayette&#x2019;s visit to their region was a great honor. Even though the citizens of Utica would have only a few hours with him, they were anxious to show off their vibrant young community. They appointed a blue-ribbon committee to plan a celebration, particularly to ensure wide exposure to civic leaders, veterans, and private citizens.4<br>&nbsp;<br>On the morning of June 10, 1825, a large contingent from Utica greeted the French hero at the small hamlet of Oriskany, a short distance to the northwest and the site of an Oneida village destroyed during the Revolutionary War. Stepping into an open carriage, the smiling Lafayette took his seat next to committee chairman Judge Nathan Williams. Following them in a lengthy procession in carriages and on horseback were prominent guests, blue-ribbon committee members, militiamen, and private citizens. People lined the route to offer welcoming cheers and then joined the convoy. When the marquis reached Utica&#x2019;s boundary, the reverberating sounds of a twenty-four-gun salute echoed through the community. The cavalcade turned onto Lafayette Street, where an assemblage of soldiers, including Revolutionary War veterans, grandly saluted the marquis. On a bridge over the Erie Canal, the local populace had constructed an arch with a flag that read, lafayette, the apostle of liberty, we hail thee&#x2014;welcome!5<br>&nbsp;<br>The column halted in front of the Shepard Hotel, where the mayor of Utica delivered some effusive remarks. Lafayette responded with his usual grace. Then he greeted &#x201c;an immense number of gentlemen of the county of Oneida and the vicinity,&#x201d; and &#x201c;in one of the most solemn and affecting scenes,&#x201d; some Revolutionary War veterans stepped forward to speak with him. A few the old general recognized. The men eventually yielded so that the women would have a chance to meet this legendary hero.6<br>&nbsp;<br>While Lafayette mingled with the citizens of Utica, a thought kept bothering him. Some persons were missing. He had visited Rome, then Oriskany, and now Utica, but he had not seen any of his Oneida Indian comrades from the days of the conflict, even though these towns were in the locale of what had once been the Oneida homeland. Finally, Lafayette wondered aloud to his hosts. He wanted to know if any Oneidas still resided in the area and if he might have the opportunity to visit with them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Lafayette&#x2019;s request caught his hosts by surprise. Many of them were too young to know the Revolution intimately, even if they had heard stories about the Oneidas fighting in conjunction with the rebels during the war. The aging veterans, however, knew better, but by virtue of their selective memories about events long since past, they had more or less divested their minds of Oneida involvement, let alone contributions. The marquis had not.7<br>&nbsp;<br>Lafayette asked if someone among his large throng of Utica admirers could take action so that he might spend at least a few moments conversing with these forgotten allies . . .<br>&nbsp;<br>Excerpted from Forgotten Allies: The Oneida Indians and the American Revolution by Joseph T.

"We love dogs because they love us, unconditionally.&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how we treat them, what we do to them, how little attention we pay to them, they are eager to please us, eager to be with us."&nbsp;&nbsp;In <b>Dogs Never Lie About Love</b>, the New York Times best-selling author of <b>When Elephants Weep </b>shifts his attention from the jungle to the living room to explore the exotic and unchartered territory of dog emotion. <br><br>Why do dogs bark?<br>Why don't cats and dogs "fight like cats and dogs"? <br>Do some dogs commit suicide from despair?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Drawing from scientific studies, legends and literature, and from the stories of dog trainers and lovers around the world, <b>Dogs Never Lie About Love</b> raises our level of consciousness to the rich and fascinating world of canine emotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book demonstrates how our affection for dogs is similar to our love of children - how both live and feel in the present, and how children and (especially) dogs are eager to offer us unconditional love.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most poignantly, however, <b>Dogs Never Lie About Love</b>, reveals that although dogs exhibit a wide range of observable emotions, love is their master emotion and is what guides and defines their existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this provocative work, Masson&nbsp;&nbsp;sweeps aside old prejudices on animal behavior and challenges scientists to resist dismissing the claim of canine emotion as anthropomorphism (assigning human characteristics to nonhumans) unless they are able to prove that dogs are emotionless animals.<br><br>Heartwarming, inspiring, and always entertaining, <b>Dogs Never Lie About Love</b> is a compelling journey into the lives of dogs, told eloquently through the observations and experiences of Masson's own three dogs Sasha, Sima, and Rani whose delightful and sometimes odd behavior provides the means to exploring a wide range of subjects:&nbsp;&nbsp;from emotions like gratitude, compassion, loneliness, and disappointment to speculating about what dogs dream, how they perceive humans and other species, and how their powerful sense of smell greatly influences their memory and experience of reality (humans have about 5 million olfactory cells, whereas dogs have up to 220 million.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dogs Never Lie About Love</b> discusses why dogs are not finicky at the dinner bowl, why no breed is aggressive by nature, and the emotional significance of tail wagging.<br><br><b>Dogs Never Lie About Love</b> will captivate readers with its inquisitive, playful, and serious sides, giving readers a new understanding of the hidden world of dog emotion.&nbsp;&nbsp;With compelling dog stories from around the world, <b>Dogs Never Lie About Love</b> offers long-overdue pause for thought about humanity's best and most loyal friend.</p><p>Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson was, oddly enough, pet-free when he decided to write about their key role in his life. Not to worry, though. In a trice he acquired a troika of pups (a purebred and two mongrels) and a couple of kittens. (The pussycats, alas, play only cameo roles.) In <i>Dogs Never Lie About Love</i>, Masson finds plenty of new things to say about canines--not that there hasn't been a plenitude of pupper reportage in the '90s. Or at least he easily articulates what some of us might already think: "Dogs feel more than I do (I am not prepared to speak for other people)," Masson asserts. "They feel more, and they feel more purely and more intensely." Often, however, he seems to be writing less about animals than humans: "In searching for why we are so inhibited compared with dogs, perhaps we can learn to be as direct, as honest, as straightforward, and especially as intense in our feelings as dogs are." But this book is not just a cozy mix of navel gazing (bestial and human) and long, leash-filled walks. Masson offers several proofs that dogs <i>do</i> take the high moral road--one police pooch, for instance, refused to acknowledge his handler's attack command.

It is the end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose.&#x201d; <br> <b>--- Ayn Rand, Anthem</b><br><br> This Novella by Ayn Rand was first published in England in 1938. It takes place at some unspecified future date when mankind has entered another dark age characterized by irrationality, collectivism, and socialistic thinking and economics. Technological advancement is now carefully planned (when it is allowed to occur at all) and the concept of individuality has been eliminated (for example, the use of the word "I" is punishable by death). Rand, as a teenager living in Soviet Russia, initially conceived Anthem as a play. This is a novel upholding Rand's central principles of her philosophy and of her heroes: reason, values, volition, individualism.</p><p>He lived in the dark ages of the future. In a loveless world he dared to love the woman of his choice. In an age that had lost all trace of science and civilization he had the courage to seek and find knowledge. But these were not the crime for which he would be hunted. He was marked for death because he had committed the unpardonable sin: he had stood forth from the mindless human herd. He was a man alone.<p>Ayn Rand's classic tale of a future dark age of the great "We" -- in which individuals have no name, no independence, and no values -- anticipates her later masterpieces, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged.</p><b>Ayn Rand (1905 - 1982)</b><br><br> Ayn Rand (born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum; February 2 [O.S.

But in fact four men were given that same name in successive generations, beginning with Yul&#x2019;s Swiss-born grandfather, Jules, and ending with his son born in New York, Yul Jr., better known as author and historian Rock Brynner. Their lives compose a global odyssey that has come full circle in present-day Vladivostok in Far East Russia, the city built by Jules in the 1880s, where Yul and his father, Boris Julievitch, were born, and which Rock first visited on a lecture tour sponsored by the U.S. State Department.<br><br>This is a vast family epic, teeming with exotic adventures, that begins aboard a pirate ship bound for Shanghai; like the fiction of Michener or Clavell, this true story is closely interwoven with history. Within twenty years of his arrival, Jules was the leading industrialist in the Far East, and the empire he created involved tiger hunters, Asian emperors, and most significantly, Tsar Nicholas II; it is revealed here exactly how their business association &#x2013; and the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway to Vladivostok &#x2013; triggered the Russo&#x2014;Japanese War that ended three centuries of Romanov autocracy. Under Lenin&#x2019;s government, Boris was the only mine owner to regain control of his vast operation; but his personal dramas in China, Manchuria, and North Korea rivaled the ordeals of Dr. Zhivago. With the Russian diaspora, Yul&#x2019;s childhood took him from Vladivostok to China and then to France, where, as a teenager, he performed in nightclubs with Russian Gypsies while becoming a trapeze acrobat in the circus. He moved to America before he spoke English and within five years was starring on Broadway; ten years later he received the Academy Award for <i>The King and I</i>. Yul&#x2019;s only son, Rock, has been a European street clown and a Broadway star, road manager for The Band and bodyguard for Muhammad Ali, as well as a novelist and historian. His numerous visits to Vladivostok, along with his research, have earned him an enduring place in its social history.</p><p>Rock Brynner has lived in Pawling, New York for almost thirty years. He has a masters degree in philosophy from Trinity College, Dublin, and a doctorate in history from Columbia University. This is his sixth book."Yul has an extra quart of champagne in his veins," an admirer once said of Yul Brynner, the exotic, charismatic actor who ruled Broadway and Hollywood for several decades and won an Academy Award for his signature role as the King of Siam in "The King and I."<p> In fact, as Empire and Odyssey reveals, Yul Brynner had the most fascinating mixture imaginable in his DNA, which accounts for the intriguing and glamorous persona that emerged.</p><p> Yul Brynner created many myths about himself, among them that he was born of a gypsy and a Mongolian Prince. But, as this family biography by his son, Rock, shows, the true story is even more extraordinary. The author is also an historian, and, unlike so many celebrity biographies, his book shows the research and panoramic view of an academic true to his calling.</p><p> In recounting the saga of four generations of the Brynner dynasty, Rock takes us from mid 19th-century Switzerland where Jules Bryner, the family patriarch, was born, to Vladivostok in Far Eastern Russia, where he settled and prospered until the Communist Revolution. The Brynner family then followed a typical trajectory of the Russian diaspora -- China, Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles with various detours along the way. The odyssey finally concludes with Rock's return to Vladivostok, made possible by the end of the Cold War.</p><p> It is a compelling story. The first Jules Bryner (originally spelled with one n; "Jules" and "Yul" are variations of the same name), of serious mien, was born into a simple Lutheran family in Switzerland, but wanderlust took him from his fatherland at a young age. He worked his way on a pirate ship to Shanghai and later to Yokohama. An astute businessman, he created a prosperous shipping agency in the rapidly opening Russian Far East. When he arrived in Vladivostok in the 1870s, it was "a collection of wood shacks set along a sleepy harbor that received only two dozen vessels a year." Jules set about to create an ideal port for his shipping company. He joined forces with other European businessmen who sensed the vast potential of this virgin city -- especially after the Trans-Siberian railroad made it possible to travel all the way West to St. Petersburg. Eventually, he became a very wealthy industrialist and one of the city's founding fathers. </p><p> In 1882, Jules married Natalya Kurkutova, who had a Tartar ancestor in her family tree. (This may explain why the actor Yul did indeed look like a descendant of Ghengis Khan.) His 16-year-old bride subsequently gave him six children, among them Boris Julievitch, the father of Yul.</p><p> By all accounts, and judging from the many wonderful photographs in the book, Boris was devastatingly handsome, and as an heir to great wealth, cut quite a princely figure, whether on tiger shoots, riding his favorite horse or traveling throughout Europe. He was also well-educated, with a degree from the Mining Institute in St. Petersburg, "the finest geological institution in the world . . . founded in 1773 by Catherine the Great." By this time the Bryner fortune also included vast timber holdings and the Tetukhe mines, noted for their silver, lead and zinc, which employed as many as 3,000 miners. </p><p> The debonair young Boris seemed to have everything. He married Maria Blagovidova, who gave birth to Vera in 1916 and then to Yul in 1920, both born in the Bryner mansion. But the family's carefree days were numbered. The Communist revolution finally enveloped the Russian Far East. Jules was almost 70 when the Russian Empire collapsed, and with it his own. He died four months after Yul was born.</p><p> Boris decided to move his family to Chinese-controlled Harbin, which was quickly becoming a mecca for Russian refugees. However, he stayed behind to rescue the Tetukhe mines and other Bryner interests and to work out a deal with the Soviets. He made frequent trips to Moscow and with his considerable charm and tenacity managed to keep the mines alive. The Bryners relied on their Swiss passports to protect them, even though the Soviets regarded them as "Russian capitalists." </p><p> In Moscow, separated from his wife and two children, Boris fell in love with Katya Kornakova, a stunning, talented actress and prot�g� of Konstantin Stanislavsky, co-founder of the Moscow Art Theatre. "There, a revolution in the theater was unfolding even as the Communist revolution proceeded at the Kremlin," Rock writes, "in the decades to come, the Bryner family would be affected as much by the former revolution as by the latter." </p><p> But the Soviet revolution would eventually catch up with them. In the end, the Bryners lost most of their wealth, and Boris, Katya and their daughter were arrested and held prisoners for six months, "interrogated, intimidated, and starved." Even so, they were among the lucky ones who managed to escape the gulag or worse thanks to the enormous diplomatic efforts of the Swiss government.</p><p> Meanwhile, Yul, his sister Vera and their mother finally left Harbin and made their way to Paris, where they lived for most of the 1930s. This was the Paris of Marc Chagall, Anna Pavlova, Vaslav Nijinsky, Igor Stravinsky and Serge Diaghilev, a haven for White Russians. Here, the teenage Yul took off on his own and lived with a family of gypsies. He learned to play the seven-string guitar and developed a repertoire of traditional Russian folk songs that he sang in nightclubs. After a stint as a lifeguard at Deauville, he joined the circus and became a trapeze artist. For a brief period he became addicted to opium but kicked the habit. Finally, he began to study the theater in earnest under the tutelage of Michael Chekhov, nephew of the great writer Anton Chekhov.</p><p> "From the trapeze and the nightclubs, Yul had learned the power of virility," Rock writes, "from Chekhov he learned the power of gentleness." Rock goes on to say that Yul radiated physicality. "He perfected vocal expression as well as physical delivery of a song, learning to gauge the immediacy and the degree of 'presence' that was called for." </p><p> After Hitler invaded France, Yul, Vera and their mother fled to New York City, which became their home for several decades and where Yul finally began his career as a Broadway star in "Lute Song." It was only a short time before Yul starred in "The King and I" and enjoyed subsequent decades of fame and adoration.</p><p> According to Hollywood lore, Yul was irresistible to the ladies. His well-known affair with Marlene Dietrich began when she was 41 and he was 21, and "their romance, which would continue off-and-on for two decades, was relentless and passionate," Rock writes. (Over the course of his star-filled life, Yul Brynner married four times. His first wife was Rock's mother, the actress Virginia Gilmore. But he also bedded a procession of famous actresses, including Marilyn Monroe.)</p><p>Rock's take on his father is loving and understanding, warts and all. "For all but a few well-grounded individuals, stardom produces an artificial and unbalanced relationship with the rest of humanity," he observes. "Psychologically, the relentless attention of complete strangers is abnormal, and gradually induces a state of perpetual self-consciousness -- not self-awareness, but self-centeredness. It is not surprising that stars feel entitled to exceptional treatment when privilege is constantly reinforced by acquaintances and strangers alike, and stardom seems to overrule civil conventions. In the midst of such exceptionalism, the golden rule is easily suspended." </p><p> After this gripping and well-written account of the first three generations, Rock's own story might have seemed less dramatic. But before he earned a PhD. in history from Columbia University, he had some memorable adventures of his own -- as a writer, musician, computer programmer, farmer, pilot, band manager and bodyguard to Muhammad Ali. </p><p> Surely his happiest accomplishment was his decision to return to Vladivostok to lecture at the invitation of the State Department. Thus he finally was able to reconnect with the Brynner past and bring the family odyssey full circle.</p><p> Rock was welcomed as a hero in Vladivostok, and the people who turned out, he discovered, were not just Yul Brynner fans. "Many were there in search of a usable past, a familiar phenomenon since the fall of Communism. After three generations in a totalitarian state that had erased, distorted, renamed or outlawed any honest history, most Russians . . . are now desperately eager to recover their pre-Soviet history, rather than have no history at all." </p><p> On this and subsequent trips, Rock visited the Bryner residence to see the room where Yul was born. It now houses the headquarters of FESCO, Jules's original Far East Shipping Company. He inspected the Tetukhe mines, made a host of new friends and fell in love with a beautiful Russian woman. And so reconnecting with that land inspired him to begin research about his forebears. With this book, Rock Brynner has done them proud. </p><p>Reviewed by Selwa Roosevelt <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

She attended George Washington Univer�sity, Cambridge University in England, where she received a master&#x2019;s in history, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School. A former Special Assis�tant to the Secretary of the Army and State Department officer, she lives in Philadelphia, where she works as an attorney.Chapter 1<br><br>One<br><br>Philadelphia, 2009<br><br>"You know, don't you, that you're looking at twenty-five to life?" Charlotte peered over the top of the file at the seventeen-year-old with the rows of tiny braids who slouched in the chair on the other side of the graffiti-covered table, staring intently at his sneakers.<br><br>The preliminary hearing had not gone well. Charlotte had hoped that the judge would take one look at Marquan's baby face, with its wide smooth cheeks and the unblinking almond-shaped eyes, and know that he was not a danger to anyone, that he did not belong here. She thought that Judge Annette D'Amici, who herself had once been a public defender, might have a soft spot for a teenager with no record of prior violence who was about the same age as her grandchildren. But in a streak of phenomenally bad luck, Judge D'Amici had called in sick, replaced for the day by Paul Rodgers. Rodgers, a political wannabe who viewed the bench as a stepping-stone to a higher state office, had earned a reputation as a hanging judge during his first term. He barely glanced at Marquan before banging his gavel and remanding him to the juvenile wing of the city prison.<br><br>Normally, Charlotte would have chalked the hearing up as a loss and gone on to her next file and courtroom, dispensing with the morning's caseload. But Marquan was different. They had met almost two years earlier when he'd been a scared fifteen-year-old brought in on a petty drug charge. There was a sparkle that told her he had intelligence, a quiet dignity in his perfect posture and the way he looked at her with those somber brown eyes, seeming to see right through. He had promise. She'd done all the things she usually didn't get to do with a docket of thousands of cases per year: getting Marquan into a first-time offenders' track that left him with no permanent record, as well as an after-school mentoring program in his neighborhood. So why was he sitting here now, dull-eyed and hardened, facing a murder charge for a carjacking gone wrong?<br><br>Because it simply wasn't enough. The after-school programs amounted to only a few hours per week, a drop in an ocean of poverty and drugs and violence and boredom in which these kids had to swim every night on the streets. There had been a police chase that ended with an SUV crushed against the pavement steps of a row house, two small children pinned fatally beneath its wheels. Marquan hadn't meant to hurt anyone; of that she was certain. He had a little brother the same age as those kids, whom he walked to school every day, escorted home again each evening. No, he had simply been along for the ride when the stupid plan was hatched and he didn't have the strength or good sense to say no.<br><br>Charlotte drummed the edge of the table, running her fingers along a heart that someone had carved into the wood with a knife. "If you would testify," she began. There had been three boys in the car, but Marquan was the only one who had not fled the scene. "I mean, if you're willing to say who was there with you . . ."<br><br>She did not finish the sentence, knowing the proposal was futile. No one talked where Marquan came from. don't snitch! screamed the brazen T_shirts of the kids she passed in the Gallery food court at lunch, kids ditching school and hanging out, waiting for trouble to find them. Snitching meant never going home again, never closing your eyes and knowing if you or your loved ones would be safe. Marquan would sooner take the sentence.<br><br>She exhaled sharply, glancing up at the water-stained ceiling. "Anything you want to tell me?" she asked, closing the file, watching for the imperceptible shake of his head. "If you change your mind, or if you need something, have your case officer call me." She pushed back from the table and stood, knocking on the door to be let out.<br><br>A few minutes later, Charlotte stepped from the elevator and made her way across the lobby of the Criminal Justice Center, thronged with prospective jurors and families of the victims and the accused who pushed past the metal detector toward the security desk for information. On the street, she swam through a cloud of cigarette smoke left by courthouse clerks lingering before the start of their day, then paused, her eyes traveling left toward the hulking Reading Terminal Market. A walk through the open stalls, a gastronomic world's fair touting everything from Amish delicacies to lo mein and cheesesteaks, would have been just the thing to clear her head, but there wasn't time.<br><br>As she reached the busy intersection beneath the shadow of City Hall, William Penn peering down piously from his perch atop the tower, Charlotte paused, inhaling the crisp late-September air. There were only a few days like this each fall in Philadelphia, before the persistent humidity of summer gave way to the cold rainy winter.<br><br>Still thinking of Marquan, Charlotte entered the office building. On the sixth floor, she stepped out of the elevator and proceeded down the drab corridor. The voice of section chief Mitch Ramirez, arguing with a prosecutor, bellowed through an open doorway. "Are you going to fucking tell me_._._._?" Charlotte smiled as she passed. Mitch was a legend among the defenders, a seventy-two-year-old dinosaur who had marched in the civil rights protests of the sixties and could still go toe to toe with the best of them when he thought his client was getting a raw deal.<br><br>She stopped before the door to her office, indiscernible from the others she had just passed. It wasn't much; a glorified closet, really, with a small desk and two chairs wedged close together-a far cry from the marble and mahogany suite she'd had when she was a summer associate at a large New York firm. But it was all hers. It had taken two years just to get it, to fight her way out of the pit of rookie defenders who shared the sea of cubicles one floor below and have a door that closed so she could hear herself think.<br><br>Charlotte reached for the handle, then stopped, studying it. The door was ajar. She was certain that she had closed it when she left for court that morning, but perhaps one of the other attorneys had dropped off a file. As she stepped inside, her breath caught.<br><br>There, in the narrow chair across from her desk, sat her ex-boyfriend.<br><br>"Brian?" she asked, as though unsure of his name. The word came out in a croak.<br><br>He stood, unfolding from the chair. Brian had the tall, broad- shouldered frame that fashion houses paid good money for, brown hair that flopped improbably to his forehead no matter how many times he got it cut to a shorter, more professional length. Despite the muscular arms that suggested a threat on the basketball court, he conveyed an air of vulnerability that implied he might cry at a chick flick and made women want to take care of him.<br><br>Looking at him now, it was almost possible to forget that he had broken her heart.<br><br>"Hello, Charlotte," he said, his use of her full name a reminder of the years that had come and gone since their last meeting. He bent to kiss her and a hint of his familiar Burberry cologne tickled her nose, sending her places she had hoped never to go again. "You're looking well." He brushed off his legs, his expensive suit woefully out of place in her tiny drab office. She was suddenly self-conscious about her black knit pantsuit, practical and unflattering. His Chanel- and-heels wife would not have been caught dead in it.<br><br>He waited for her to speak, then filled the silence when she did not. "I didn't mean to startle you. Your secretary let me in."<br><br>She did not, Charlotte reminded herself, have a secretary. He must have been referring to Doreen, the office admin. Doreen was usually too busy updating her Facebook page to help visitors, but it was easy to see how Brian might have charmed her into unlocking the office and letting him wait. She studied him again. There was a paunch that bespoke too many overpriced steakhouse dinners, missed visits to the racquet club he once frequented daily. But he still had that appeal that had sucked her in almost a decade ago-that had gotten her in trouble in the first place.<br><br>She took a deep breath, centered herself. "What are you doing here?"<br><br>His expression changed as he processed the new rules of the game: pleasantries were to be dispensed with, business stated. "I'm in town for work and I was hoping to talk to you about something."<br><br>You've left Danielle, she thought suddenly. Realized after all these years that you made a fatal mistake, that I was the one. The scenario rushed through her head: his profuse apologies and tears, her eventual gracious acceptance and forgiveness. It would be messy, of course. There was the divorce, the question of whether to reside here or in New York. "About a case I'm working on," he added.<br><br>The vision evaporated, a raindrop on a warm, humid day, so quickly gone she might have imagined it. So this isn't about us after all, she thought, feeling very foolish. Brian wanted something, but it wasn't her.<br><br>"Let me buy you lunch?" he asked.<br><br>She shook her head. Thirty seconds around Brian and he was already toying with her mind. She needed to get as far away from him as possible. "I can't. I'm due back in court in half an hour."<br><br>"Of course. Dinner then. Does six work?" She could see him calculating the time that the meal might take, whether he could make the nine o'clock train back to Manhattan. Back to Danielle. Her stomach twisted, the bile undiluted by the years.<br><br>For a second she considered taking back an ounce of the control that had been stolen from her all those years ago and declining his last- minute invitation. She might have plans after all. Usually they consisted of nothing more than Thai takeout in front of the television, a hot night of CSI reruns with her cat, Mitzi, but he didn't have to know that. Her curiosity was piqued, though. Did Brian really have business in Philadelphia or had he come all this way just to see her? And what on earth could it be about?<br><br>"All right," she replied, trying to sound casual.<br><br>"Buddakan?"

His rigid, religious father, who hits his wife and children, warns Thomas, "Only good-for-nothings and weaklings are happy." Fortunately, Thomas is aided by a neighbor, who introduces him to Beethoven and poetry; a remarkable older girl with a leather leg; and even the Lord Jesus, who actually communicates with Thomas from time to time: "Hey there, Thomas. Everything under control?" Set in Amsterdam in 1951, this slender Dutch novel is filled with quirky characters, frightening family confrontations, and laugh-out-loud moments. Dark humor and a wry, ironic tone, reminiscent of Kurt Vonnegut, give the story a sharp edge. In a faux introduction, the author explains how the elderly Thomas gave him the book and warned him that he should read it first because it "may be too disrespectful." This irreverence may disturb some but delight others, who will cheer on the earnest, good-hearted Thomas. <i>Linda Perkins</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Available in stores now.</b><br><i>Tip #01</i><br>Campaign: Unlike with other Brutes, you cannot stick grenades to the bodies of Chieftains, and they&#x2019;re quicker to dive when you throw explosives. To kill them in this way, you need to aim specifically for their weapon. A Plasma Grenade stuck to a Chieftain&#x2019;s Gravity Hammer or Plasma Turret can result in an instant kill &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s an art that few players will master.<br><i>Tip #02</i><br>With the new &#x201c;sword parry&#x201d; feature, using an Energy Sword against an opponent armed with the same weapon is much more tactical. In a sword versus sword fight, you can now stop a lunging duelist in their tracks and block by pressing the melee button. If your timing is precise, the parry will stun your opponent briefly, offering a window of opportunity for you to run them through with your own lunge.<br><i>Tip #03</i><br>When you attack from behind cover, take your weapons into account. If you are using a single firearm, such as a Battle Rifle or large turret, it&#x2019;s better to move out to attack from the right-hand side &#x2013; that way, you will present a slightly smaller target to your opponents. When you dual wield and your &#x201c;lead&#x201d; weapon is in your left hand &#x2013; a Plasma Pistol or Plasma Rifle, for instance &#x2013; the opposite applies. <br><i>Tip #04</i><br>If you press and hold the zoom button, you will return to the previous zoom level immediately when you remove your thumb. This is an interesting feature when you wield scoped weapons, particularly the Sniper Rifle and Beam Rifle. It&#x2019;s almost certainly too awkward for snipers to line up a shot with the thumbstick depressed, but it&#x2019;s handy if you need to briefly take a closer look at something.<br><i>Tip #05</i><br>Multiplayer: As soon as you spawn, grab the first weapon you encounter as backup to your Assault Rifle. Even if you set off with the express intention of collecting a particular firearm, it always pays to have a second gun in reserve. Rather than reloading the Assault Rifle when its clip is exhausted in a skirmish, you can switch to your other weapon to finish your adversary off.<br><i>Tip #06</i><br>Throwing grenades to soften up opponents before you launch an attack is a highly profitable tactic. The shield damage and momentary disorientation can enable you to seize the advantage against adversaries armed with far superior weapons. Grenades can also be employed to deter assailants from giving chase, especially when you run through doors, which can provide time for your shield to recharge. Spike Grenades are remarkably efficient in enclosed spaces. Not only will the spikes rebound from nearby surfaces, you can plant them on walls and ceilings to give a player in pursuit a nasty shock.<br><i>Tip #07</i><br>As in Halo 2, you can melee attack the Ghost&#x2019;s &#x201c;wings&#x201d; to destroy them, which may enable you to squeeze the vehicle into places that it is not, at least <i>technically</i>, supposed to be in.<br><i>Tip #08</i><br>If you are confronted by an enemy sniper (whether human or Covenant), concentrate on keeping your adversary &#x201c;descoped&#x201d; &#x2013; that is, shoot them in measured bursts to prevent them from zooming in and making a precision shot. <br><i>Tip #09</i><br>Campaign: You can destroy Infection Forms as they begin to burrow their way into the chest cavities of living creatures or corpses. However, you should refrain from shooting cadavers during the Flood transformation sequence &#x2013; until they begin to clamber to their feet, you&#x2019;re simply wasting ammunition. <br><i>Tip #10</i><br>Multiplayer: If you crouch as you walk, you will be invisible to enemy Motion Trackers. Naturally, this is only of use in Game Types and Variants that don&#x2019;t reveal your position with a waypoint marker. Crouching while airborne will enable you to slightly extend the duration of a leap, and even reach heights or distances that are not possible with a standard jump.</p><h2>Samplers (Shire Collections)</h2><p>Samplers have a long history in Britain and the United States, dating from the sixteenth century. They were originally a collection of patterns gathered together for easy reference to be used in embroidery and needlepoint lace.

Written by Britain's leading experts on the subject, and illustrated with superb photographs of a great range of samplers, this title provides an ideal introduction for the collector, art historian and social historian of these amazing embroidered pictures.</p><p>Joy Jarrett has run Witney antiques, one of the most exclusive antique dealers outside London, for many years.

Edwards Award. She lives in Oregon.Grade 2-4 At first Mrs. Jane Tabby can't understand why her four kittens have been born with wings. Then she realizes that they will be able to fly away from their dreary and dangerous city neighborhood. (Mrs. T. can't come with them because she is going to marry Mr. Tom Jones, and ``I don't want you children underfoot!'') So the kittens sadly leave their mother and go off into the world. After some mild adventures, they settle in a wooded area and learn to forage for themselves. Then danger appears in the form of a large owl. Luckily at this point Harriet, the smallest kitten, discovers Susan and Hank Brown from a neighboring farm. The tale ends happily with the cats snuggled up to the children and the promise of a safe new home. Cats are always appealing, and winged cats should be doubly so. However, the story barely skirts cuteness; the language has a self-conscious tone which works against the action of the plot. Softly-colored ink drawings add an old-fashioned tone, as do the Victorian names of the cats. Ruth S. Vose, San Francisco Pub .

Among their leaders was <b>Ralph Waldo Emerson</b>, whose essays, lectures, and poems defined the American transcendentalist movement, though he himself disliked the term. <br><br>Emerson advocates a rejection of fear-driven conformity, a total independence of thought and spirit, and a life lived in harmony with nature. He believes that Truth lies within each individual, for each is part of a greater whole, a universal &#x201c;over-soul&#x201d; through which we transcend the merely mortal. <br><br>Emerson was extremely prolific throughout his life; his collected writings fill forty volumes.

A specialist in New England transcendentalism and the history of the antebellum period, he also has published on Herman Melville&#x2019;s poetry. He currently is writing a history of Emerson&#x2019;s career as a public lecturer. <br><br><b>From Peter Norberg's Introduction to <i>Essays and Poems by Ralph Waldo Emerson</i></b> <br><br>In the face of this new materialism, Emerson feared that America was losing its most valuable resource&#x2014;the individual&#x2014;as men and women increasingly defined themselves in terms of their professions and their possessions. "The tradesman scarcely ever gives an ideal worth to his work, but is ridden by the routine of his craft, and the soul is subject to dollars," he lamented in "The American Scholar." "The priest becomes a form; the attorney, a statute-book; the mechanic, a machine; the sailor, a rope of a ship". The alienation that results from conformity could be overcome only by a radical break with custom and tradition. "If you maintain a dead church, contribute to a dead Bible society, vote with a great party either for the Government or against it," he wrote in "Self-Reliance," ". . . under all these screens I have difficulty to detect the precise man you are. . . . But do your work, and I shall know you. Do your work, and you shall reinforce yourself" . For Emerson, our ability to think and act on our own terms was ultimately the strongest corrective to conformity. "In all of my lectures," he wrote in his journal in 1840, "I have preached one doctrine, namely, the infinitude of the private man" (<i>Journals and Miscellaneous Notebooks</i>, vol. 7, p. 342; see "For Further Reading"). By keeping this a continual refrain throughout his career, he placed the individual at the center of American culture as a critical counterforce to the mentality of mass consumerism. Today, when the pressures placed on individuals to conform to the material values of American culture are perhaps stronger than ever, readers young and old will find Emerson's essays a resource for personal, intellectual, and professional renewal.<br>The emphasis Emerson placed on the individual was grounded in his theological beliefs. Human life, as well as nature, was a manifestation of divinity. In moments of genuine inspiration or original action, the individual did not think or act from himself but was a conduit for what Emerson variously referred to as "Supreme Mind," "Universal Being," or "the Over-soul." "We lie in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us organs of its activity and receivers of its truth," he wrote in "Self-Reliance." "When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow a passage to its beams". This fact is easy to overlook in an increasingly secular world, but it is essential for understanding the difference between Emersonian self-reliance and what Albert J. von Frank has termed the "predatory individualism" of the expansionist era.<br>Equally important is some knowledge of Emerson's personal experience of the transient nature of human life. From his childhood until the middle of his life, Emerson lived through the tragic loss of those closest to him. His father died less than two weeks before Emerson's eighth birthday; his three-year-old sister, Mary Caroline, when he was ten. His first wife, Ellen Tucker, suffered from tuberculosis, and Emerson probably knew she would die young when they married. Still, when she succumbed to the disease at the age of nineteen, before their second wedding anniversary, he was devastated.<br>Tuberculosis was widespread in New England. Emerson showed symptoms of it himself. It claimed the lives of two of his brothers, Edward at the age of twenty-nine and Charles at thirty-two. They were his closest confidants. Following Charles's funeral, Emerson is reported to have said, "When one has never had but little society&#x2014;and all that society is taken away&#x2014;what is there worth living for?" Finally, in 1842, when Emerson was thirty-eight and happily married to his second wife, Lydia Jackson, their eldest son, Waldo, died of scarlet fever. He was five. Emerson's optimistic affirmations of the individual take on new urgency when read in light of this litany of loss.<br>When he writes in <i>Nature</i> that our "relation to the world . . . is not to be learned by any addition or subtraction or other comparison of known quantities, but is arrived at by untaught sallies of the spirit, by a continual self-recovery, and by entire humility", the "self-recovery" he speaks of is not simply a return to one's sense of self. It is a recovery from our failures, and especially from the failure of what we thought we knew, in the face of experiences that indicate otherwise. At times in his essays, Emerson will entertain the deepest skepticism. "No picture of life can have any veracity that does not admit the odious facts", he wrote in "Fate." Among these facts is the awful truth that not just our knowledge, but our loves and friendships are partial and temporary. "Souls never touch their objects," he wrote in "Experience." "An unnavigable sea washes with silent waves between us and the things we aim at and converse with". And yet, in the face of these facts, Emerson still affirms the beauty and value of human life. Confronting the mixed bag of human experience&#x2014;what he jokingly calls "the pot-luck of the day"&#x2014;he insists that "if we will take the good we find, asking no questions, we shall have heaping measures". These are not the words of an idealistic dreamer, as Emerson has sometimes been portrayed. They are an expression of his confidence in man's ability to meet and master his circumstances; they are a call for a pragmatic engagement of the world in which we find ourselves.<br><br></p><h2>Black Sheep</h2><p><p>Abigail Wendover, on the shelf at 28, is kept busy when her niece falls head over heels in love with a handsome fortune hunter and Abbie is forced into a confrontation with his scandalous uncle.</p><p></p><p>Miles Calvery is the black sheep of his family&#x2014;enormously rich from a long sojourn in India, disconcertingly blunt and brash.

Among the highlights of the search are the discoveries of fascinating hand-stitched textiles largely unknown to the general public. The Gatewood quilt (1795), for example, is one of the oldest quilts made I North America. It was carried into the Appalachian Mountains by a widower and his sons who were among the area&#39;s early settlers. The Kee quilt (1805) bears a distinctive Irish Chain pattern that was stitched with Irish linen thread before crossing the Atlantic. It is preserved today by the quiltmaker&#39;s family in West Virginia. These and other unique and priceless artifacts are the subjects of West Virginia Quilts and Quiltmakers, which is a tribute to quiltmakers in every era, but especially to the women of West Virginia&#39;s past, who communicated their aspirations and affection through these creations of beauty, skill, and selfless labor.&#34;</p><p><p><b>Fawn Valentine</b> has written and lectured extensively on quilts and quiltmaking. She lives in rural Monroe County, West Virginia.</p>This work is the culmination of a ten-year project undertaken by quilt historian Valentine and the West Virginia Heritage Quilt Search to document quilts made in West Virginia before 1940. Thousands of people brought their family heirloom quilts to regional sites, where the quilts were measured and photographed. Offered here are 159 color photographs of quilts, with small maps showing the county in which they were made. Detailed and thoughtful essays describe the artistic composition and fabric selection of each textile masterpiece. Often a photograph of the quiltmaker is included. Not just a survey, this oral history offers a unique social perspective on domestic life. An analysis of more than 4000 quilts and a verity of appendixes further the academic usefulness of this title. Recommended for both popular and academic quilt collections in all types of libraries.

Beginning with the Long Walk of the Navajos in 1860 and ending 30 years later with the massacre of Sioux men, women, and children at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, it tells how the American Indians lost their land and lives to a dynamically expanding white society. During these three decades, America's population doubled from 31 million to 62 million. Again and again, promises made to the Indians fell victim to the ruthlessness and greed of settlers pushing westward to make new lives. The Indians were herded off their ancestral lands into ever-shrinking reservations, and were starved and killed if they resisted. It is a truism that "history is written by the victors"; for the first time, this book described the opening of the West from the Indians' viewpoint. Accustomed to stereotypes of Indians as red savages, white Americans were shocked to read the reasoned eloquence of Indian leaders and learn of the bravery with which they and their peoples endured suffering. With meticulous research and in measured language overlaying brutal narrative, Dee Brown focused attention on a national disgrace. Still controversial but with many of its premises now accepted, <i>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</i> has sold 5 million copies around the world. Thirty years after it first broke onto the national conscience, it has lost none of its importance or emotional impact. <i>--John Stevenson</i>12 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Agent Bishop: True Stories from an FBI Agent Moonlighting as a Mormon Bishop</h2><p>When Mike got his dream job as an FBI agent, he never thought he would also be called as an LDS bishop four times!

In the triple goddess concept of Maiden, Mother, and Crone, there is no designation for what 20th-century women are experiencing as their most important years. Drawing from their work in women&#39;s health, spirituality, and psychology, the authors fill this void with a new wheel of archetypes to include a fourthMatriarch.</p><p>A renowned expert on women's issues, Elizabeth Davis has been a midwife, women's health care specialist, educator, and consultant for more than twenty years. She holds a degree in Holistic Maternity Care from Antioch University and has served as president of the Midwifery Education Accreditation Council of the United States. Internationally active in women's rights, she travels and lectures widely on women's spirituality, sexuality, and the Blood Mysteries. Her books include: the classic <i>Heart and Hands: A Midwife's Guide to Pregnancy and Birth; Energetic Pregnancy; Women's Intuition;</i> and <i>Women, Sex and Desire: Exploring Your Sexuality at Every Stage of Life</i>. She lives in Windsor, California and is the mother of three children. <br><br>A foremother of the women's spirituality movement, Carol Leonard has been a practicing midwife for more than twenty years and was co-founder of the Midwives Alliance of North America, serving one term as president. Her work to improve maternity care in Moscow was featured on the news program <i>20/20</i> and written into the Congressional Record. She facilitates a summer camp for young women and does healing work for women with chronic and terminal illnesses. She travels extensively to present her workshops, <i>Women's Ordinary Magic </i>(which explores women's Blood Mysteries), and <i>Witches, Midwives, and Other Healers. </i>She raises medicinal herbs in New Hampshire and is the mother of two children.Steeped in New Age rhetoric and references, this work targets the true believer. Authors Davis and Leonard have drawn inspiration from their experiences as midwives, as participants in "women's circles," and as students of tribal beliefs to devise a system that identifies 12 stages in a woman's life. These archetypes correspond to general goddess stereotypes and may be understood through instinct rather than reason. Women move from one phase to another using a 13th or transformer stage. The authors encourage those in this position to consult tarot cards, runes, or the I Ching to facilitate the transition. Throughout the book are testimonials given by individuals, identified solely by age, who share the same jargon and perspective. Only libraries desperate to fill gaps in their New Age or occult collections should consider this cultish manual.<br><i>Rose M.

They were retracing the route of the Navajo deity Naayee neizghani, the Slayer of Alien Gods, on his quest to restore beauty and balance to the Earth. More than a travelogue, Preston&#39;s account of the journey is a tale of two cultures meeting in a sacred land.Douglas Preston has written several books on the Southwest. He is also the coauthor of the novels <i>Relic, Riptide,</i> and <i>Thunderhead</i> (1999).</p><h2>The Camera My Mother Gave Me</h2><p><i>The Camera My Mother Gave Me</i> takes us through Susanna Kaysen&#x2019;s often comic, sometimes surreal encounters with all kinds of doctors&#x2014;internists, gynecologists, &#x201c;alternative health&#x201d; experts&#x2014;as well as with her boyfriend and her friends, when suddenly, inexplicably, &#x201c;something went wrong&#x201d; with her vagina. <br><br>The title comes from Luis Bu�uel&#x2019;s film <i>Viridiana</i>. Some peasants are at a banquet in a country mansion. They ask a maid to take a group snapshot, and she obliges, lifting up her skirt and using the &#x201c;camera&#x201d; that&#x2019;s underneath.<br><br>Kaysen&#x2019;s <i>The Camera My Mother Gave Me </i>observes what happens when sexual pleasure is replaced by pain. &#x201c;When eros goes away,&#x201d; she writes, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s as if I&#x2019;m colorblind. The world is gray.&#x201d; But is this a problem of body, or mind? And can clinicians tease out the difference between the two?<br><br>Spare, frank, and altogether original, <i>The Camera My Mother Gave Me</i> challenges us to think in new ways about the centrality and power of sexuality. It is an extraordinary investigation into the role sex plays in perception and our notions of ourselves&#x2014;and into what happens when the erotic impulse meets the world of medicine</p><p>This isn't a book you'll want to pull out on a crowded train, with clinical terms like <i>clitoris</i> and <i>vulvologist</i>, not to mention earthier ones like the <i>F</i> word, on virtually every page to attract the startled attention of the passenger in the next seat. Bluntly describing her yearlong effort to deal with a searing pain in her vagina, Susanna Kaysen doesn't stint on the details of what this malady did to her relationship with her boyfriend (nothing good), nor is she forgiving of the callousness and stupidity displayed by some of her doctors and various alternative health practitioners. Yet her appalling saga is compulsively readable, thanks to Kaysen's propulsive prose and sharp dialogue. She's particularly good at capturing the way people talk about their ailments over dinner and in the middle of other activities. Conversations with friends ramble from her medical problem to tiger maple furniture in an utterly convincing way, and one darkly funny scene shows a pal urging Kaysen to buy a coral necklace following a particularly horrid visit to the doctor because, "You have to get a nice thing after that appointment." Kaysen's laconic humor keeps the book from seeming self-pitying, though her terseness tends to muffle its emotional impact; she expresses her emotions without really conveying them to the reader in any depth. Nonetheless, the pared-down candor that made her portrait of mental illness so gripping in <i>Girl, Interrupted</i> also distinguishes this account of a decidedly physical affliction. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>&#34;A vagina dialogue: pithy, funny, adventurous, sexy, and eye-opening. . . . Disguised as plain, brown memoir, [this is] a voluptuous exploration of sexuality, aging, the failures of modern medicine, attempts at self-knowledge, and the meaning of pain.&#34;- Kirkus</p><h2>Hollyhock Days: Garden Adventures for the Young at Heart</h2><p>Describes the pleasures of gardening, and discusses compost, bulbs, garden planning, mulberries, butterflies, carrots, toads, spiders, lady bugs, and hummingbirds</p><p>Gardening is fun, and it can also be funny-all you need is good soil, water, sunshine, seeds, and a sense of humor.

Who&#x2019;s Heath, you ask? Well&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that&#x2019;s where things get a little complicated.</p><p>In order to tell you who Heath is, I need to swear you to secrecy. Not the &#x201c;Oh, I will only tell my eleventy million friends on Facebook&#x2014;pinkie swear&#x201d; kind of secret.</p><p>An. Actual. Secret.</p><p>See, the last time I checked in with you all, Heath was simply my boyfriend. My love. My partner in both the business and domestic sense, and yes, sometimes our domestic stuff is all about the &#x201c;bidness,&#x201d; but I digress. Or first, perhaps I must explain.</p><p>About eight months ago &#x201c;the call&#x201d; came in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and by that I mean that myself, Heath, Gilley, and respective members of our <i>Ghoul Getters</i> cast were made rich, I tell you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>rich</i>!</p><p>The call was from a major motion picture studio, which had agreed to distribute a movie we&#x2019;d made a few years back while on location for our TV ghostbusting show, <i>Ghoul Getters</i>. The individual episode and all of the extra footage from one particular ghostbust we&#x2019;d done in Scotland had been purchased by a production company&#x2014;Prescott Productions&#x2014;but the production company had needed the backing of a major motion picture studio to green-light the distribution before the movie actually got funded and any of us got paid. For several years all that extra footage just sat on the shelf, but just when we&#x2019;d all given up the dream, the call had come in that the movie was a go.</p><p>In fact, <i>The Haunting of the Grim Widow </i>was set to release in theaters everywhere a week after Heath and I got back from our trip. I hadn&#x2019;t actually seen the completed film yet, mostly because I&#x2019;d barely lived through my encounter with the Widow and had no urge to relive it.</p><p>Still, we had captured some stuff on film that would make your hair curl, and luckily for us, some studio execs finally took notice. They were now all over the idea of promoting a &#x201c;real&#x201d; horror flick that was as creepy as <i>The Conjuring</i>, without all the special effects.</p><p>What that had meant for us, specifically, was a <i>considerable</i> signing bonus, with an additional amount due later in the form of a portion of the box office in royalties. In other words, the second we stopped taping our last <i>Ghoul Getters</i> episode, none of us&#x2014;the talent and our small crew&#x2014;ever really had to work again if we were careful and invested wisely, of course.</p><p>Anyway, it&#x2019;d taken about seven months to finish that last location shoot for <i>GG</i>, but at the end of the week, we each received our first big check.</p><p>Now, money will motivate you in a way that you might not think. It makes you do things impulsively, the way finding out you have only a short time to live does. Most of us did things that we might not otherwise have done if not afforded the freedom that a big pile of moolah gave us.</p><p>Gilley (my BFF and our tech expert on the shoots) proposed to Michel, our cameraman and Gilley&#x2019;s boyfriend, on the same day that Michel proposed to him. It was insanely cute to see the recap of the two flash mobs brought together at the same restaurant, not having any knowledge of each other, and have it dissolve into something resembling the Sharks and the Jets. In the end there were a <i>lot</i> of tired dancers and nearly a million hits on YouTube, and Gil and Michel were engaged, so it worked out okay.</p><p>Our director, Peter Gopher, funded a documentary he&#x2019;d been trying to get off the ground and set off to Nepal to begin filming.</p><p>John and Kim, our sound guy and production assistant, booked a trip to Asia and were slowly making their way across the region, keeping us updated through Facebook posts and the like.</p><p>Meg, our adorable hair and makeup assistant, had promptly gone back to college up in Montreal, and she&#x2019;d also paid off her parents&#x2019; mortgage.</p><p>And Heath and I got married. (You read that right. We got hitched.) By the way, <i>that&#x2019;s</i> the part y&#x2019;all need to keep on the down low, because if Gilley finds out that I got married before him, well, I&#x2019;m likely never to hear the end of it.</p><p>Our wedding was truly impulsive. Heath surprised me at the end of March with a three-week trip to St. Thomas. Have you ever been to St. Thomas? It&#x2019;s gorgeous. <i>Gorgeous!</i> Think aqua blue water, white sandy beaches, drinks in coconuts, genuinely lovely people, and romantic ambiance out the yin-yang.</p><p>On our second day there he left me a note asking me to be his for the day and to meet him for a romantic walk along the beach. From our cabana I traveled down a bamboo walkway and around a little bend to find my beautiful man, standing there with a rose in his hand. As I approached he got down on bended knee and said, &#x201c;Em, will you be mine, not just for today, but forever?&#x201d;</p><p>He then presented me with the most beautiful ring you&#x2019;ve ever seen. But I&#x2019;d have said yes if it was carved from a puka shell. They don&#x2019;t make men like Heath in abundance. I&#x2019;m lucky.</p><p>So, we spent the first week of our engagement talking about our future, and by the end of that beautiful week, we both knew we didn&#x2019;t feel like waiting to call each other husband and wife.</p><p>We were married by a local justice of the peace in the waning light of the setting sun, with purple, pink, and peach streaks coating the tropical sky and the sound of the rolling surf the only music to be had. I wore a soft peach sundress I found at a shop in town, and Heath wore a light blue shirt, white shorts, and a smile as wide as Texas. It was perfect.</p><p>The next week we had ourselves a proper honeymoon, and now we were back in Boston, wading through a steady drizzle and miserably cold temps, but our spirits were in no way diminished. &#x201c;What time are we meeting Gil?&#x201d; my husband asked as we came through the door shaking our umbrellas.</p><p>I nearly tripped over the small pile of mail that&#x2019;d been shoved through the mail slot.</p><p>&#x201c;Seven,&#x201d; I told him, flipping on the light before stooping to gather some of the mail and glancing at my watch. It was ten to five. Traffic had been horrible&#x2014;given both the weather and the onset of rush hour, it&#x2019;d taken more than an hour to get from the airport to my office, a commute that normally takes only about twenty minutes. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re meeting for dinner before he heads to the opening of the exhibit.&#x201d; The studio was sponsoring an exhibit of items from the movie and our TV show to create some buzz for the actual premiere of the movie, which would be released the following week. The Boston premiere of the movie was going to be shown at the IMAX theater that was housed in a building adjacent to the Museum of Modern Science&#x2014;and that was also the location for the <i>Ghoul Getters</i> exhibit.</p><p>Paranormal investigations weren&#x2019;t exactly considered &#x201c;modern science&#x201d; by the museum&#x2019;s standards, but the studio had thrown a <i>lot</i> of money at them, and they&#x2019;d come around. (Surprise, surprise.)</p><p>&#x201c;You still don&#x2019;t want to go?&#x201d; Heath asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Gilley will be there to represent us,&#x201d; I said to Heath. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m way too tired to go to that thing. I&#x2019;d much prefer a relaxing, low-key evening and a good meal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably not gonna be very relaxing if we meet Gil for dinner,&#x201d; Heath muttered, but I&#x2019;d heard him. And I could sympathize.</p><p>Gil had talked of little else but his wedding for months, and we were all well and truly sick of it. He was going big&#x2014;as he had a nice big pile of money to play with&#x2014;and no one could seem to rein him in. I&#x2019;d decided early on to withhold any and all opinions, sage advice, judgmental looks, or mutterings on the matter. If my BFF wanted to be a diva, and a ginormous wedding would make him happy, then so be it.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s our plan?&#x201d; Heath said, plopping into a chair in front of my desk.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I said, extending my left hand to smile again at the wedding and engagement rings. &#x201c;I have to hide the evidence for a little while. Just until I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s not going to be upset by the news that we got married first.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So, until after he gets married?&#x201d; Heath asked.</p><p>I ducked my chin. &#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; I said, swiveling in the chair to move aside a cabinet door that hid a small safe.</p><p>&#x201c;Em,&#x201d; Heath said, &#x201c;he&#x2019;s not getting married until <i>September</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>My shoulders sagged. This coming back to reality was a real bummer. &#x201c;I know, honey, I know. But you&#x2019;ve seen how he can be. He&#x2019;ll perceive it as our upstaging him, and he&#x2019;s in such an emotional state as it is&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only because he&#x2019;s turned into a groomzilla,&#x201d; Heath interrupted.</p><p>I sighed, swiveling back to my husband with hands up in surrender. &#x201c;Okay. How about we wait just a little while. Until we find a good moment to tell him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We could always tell Michel and have him spill the beans.&#x201d;</p><p>That made me laugh. &#x201c;You are such a chicken,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;And no way are we doing that to poor Michel. Gilley is fully capable of shooting the messenger.&#x201d;</p><p>Heath grimaced, but then he seemed to brighten. &#x201c;You know, maybe it won&#x2019;t be so bad. Maybe he&#x2019;ll be happy for us instead of thinking we stole his spotlight.&#x201d;</p><p>My jaw dropped. &#x201c;Excuse me, but have you <i>met</i> Gilley Gillespie?&#x201d;</p><p>Heath&#x2019;s grimace returned. &#x201c;If he&#x2019;s gonna freak out about our being married, what&#x2019;s he going say about the fact that we&#x2019;re moving to Santa Fe?&#x201d;</p><p>That&#x2019;s another big change that I forgot to tell you about. Heath and I had decided to retire from Boston and move to Santa Fe to be closer to his family. It&#x2019;d be a big adjustment for me, but in recent months I&#x2019;d grown closer and closer to his mom and his cousins. They were such lovely, warm, and welcoming people, and now that they were also my family, I wanted to be near them.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll cross that bridge when we come to it,&#x201d; I told him.</p><p>&#x201c;Like when Gilley and Michel are off on their honeymoon?&#x201d; Heath said hopefully.</p><p>I pointed at him. &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d; Then I turned away to bend over and fiddle with the dial on the safe. &#x201c;Honey, could you hand over your ring?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m going to hold on to it, Em.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked over my shoulder at him. He was tugging on his wedding ring, about to take it off. &#x201c;You sure you don&#x2019;t want me to put it in here where it&#x2019;ll be safe?&#x201d; I asked, a bit worried he&#x2019;d lose it.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said, still tugging. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s my good luck charm.&#x201d;</p><p>That made me smile, and I went back to focusing on the combination to the safe. After opening it up, I took off my rings and was about to place them on the bottom shelf when something inside the safe caught my eye.</p><p>Or rather, it was the absence of something that caught my eye. <i>&#x201c;Ohmigod!&#x201d;</i></p><p>Heath came around the desk and over to me. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>I pointed inside. &#x201c;The dagger! The dagger! It&#x2019;s gone!&#x201d;</p><p>Heath stared first at me, then inside the safe, and the color drained from his face.</p><p>For the past few years we&#x2019;d kept an extremely rare and incredibly dangerous relic in our safe: a dagger once owned by a particularly evil and quite deadly Turkish warlord named Oru�.</p><p>Heath and I had first met at a hotel in San Francisco, where we&#x2019;d been hired as the talent on another cable TV show, a special called <i>Haunted Possessions</i>. We were two of the four mediums hired as the talent to assess various objects that were said to have been possessed by evil spirits. Of all the objects put in front of us, only Oru�&#x2019;s dagger had truly been possessed by something evil&#x2014;and evil he was.</p><p>Oru� had lived several centuries earlier, and he&#x2019;d developed a lust for killing young women by stabbing them with his dagger.</p><p>After he was murdered by a woman he tried to kill&#x2014;with the dagger&#x2014;his ghost figured out a way to use the dagger as a portal, which is a sort of gateway between our world and the lower realms, where evil things lurk.</p><p>Oru�&#x2019;s ghost was a crazy powerful spook in his own right, and his ability to completely possess anyone who handled the dagger was a very scary thing. His spirit could completely overtake the person in question and force him or her to commit murder.</p><p>If that weren&#x2019;t reason enough to lock the dagger away, it came with an added terrifying bonus: The dagger was also the portal for a demon that I don&#x2019;t think was ever of this world.</p><p>Oru�&#x2019;s demon was truly a monster. I&#x2019;d never actually seen it, but I&#x2019;d sure as hell felt it, and I had the scars on my back to prove it.</p><p>Its presence was big, like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <i>big</i>, and it would strike by swiping at us with its three talons. We knew they were talons because everywhere the demon struck it left that distinctive three-line gouge&#x2014;in walls, in furniture, in flesh. It had been somewhat neutralized back when we&#x2019;d first encountered it, meaning that it hadn&#x2019;t been powerful enough to ever show its true form, but one of my biggest fears was that someday, that demon would figure out a way to escape the dagger again, and if it ever became powerful enough to do that, then there was no telling what harm it might cause.</p><p>After first encountering the dagger and its horrors, we&#x2019;d had a hell of a time putting those two genies back in their bottles, so to speak, and sadly, not before more than one person had been killed. Since then, however, we&#x2019;d taken every precaution with it, securing it with powerful magnets that blocked the portal&#x2019;s gateway and wouldn&#x2019;t allow anything from the lower realms to come through.</p><p>Essentially, we&#x2019;d sent Oru� and his demon back to the lower realms where they belonged, and as long as we had possession of the dagger, I knew with some certainty that the warlord and the demon were sufficiently shut down. But now the dagger was missing, and my first thought was one of panic, because in the wrong hands that thing was&#x2014;at best&#x2014;deadly. &#x201c;Ohmigod,&#x201d; I whispered as I continued to stare at the inside of the safe. &#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be gone. It can&#x2019;t!&#x201d;</p><p>Heath moved a little closer to me and began pulling other things out of the safe. There was a wad of cash for emergencies, the lease for our office, and a few other odds and ends, but no dagger. No magnets either, but that hardly mattered with the dagger missing.</p><p>&#x201c;What the hell, Em?&#x201d; he said when he&#x2019;d emptied the contents of the safe.</p><p>I stared wide-eyed at him. &#x201c;It was there before we left for vacation,&#x201d; I swore. &#x201c;I know it was because I had to move it to one side to get to our passports. Sometime in the last three weeks, somebody got into the safe and took it.&#x201d;</p><p>Heath stared at me; then he inspected the door to the safe, which showed no tampering. &#x201c;Who the hell knew about the dagger and also knew the combination?&#x201d;</p><p>A trickle of sweat slid down ...</p></p><h2>Just Standards Real Book, C Edition Fakebook</h2><p>Contains 250 classic songs, from show tunes to jazz standards.

So when Savitha enters their household, Poornima is intrigued by the joyful, independent-minded girl.

While no women suffer that fate in this contemporary novel, that's practically the only bad thing that doesn't happen to best friends Poornima and Savitha, who grow up in rural India. The two young women become soul mates as they work long hours together in Poornima's father's weaving hut, but a late-night attack on Savitha forces her out of Poornima's life shortly before Poornima enters an arranged marriage. Shobha Rao's writing power builds in the spaces between words, her lean prose making the glimpses she shows of the breathtaking misogyny the girls endure all the more horrifying. This is not an emotionally gentle novel. You'll be outraged and hopeful, shocked and awakened. And throughout, Poornima and Savitha do burn brighter, fueled by their unshakable determination to find each other again. <em>&#x2014;Adrian Liang, Amazon Book Review</em>Shobha Rao moved to the United States from India at the age of seven.

Folks in our neighborhood milled in the steamy streets, sweat-soaked and frowning. It was even hotter elsewhere: While other cities boiled over, Gateway mostly simmered. There was no question, though, that the temperature was steadily rising. Young men no longer hailed each other with an innocuous wave; instead they thrust black fists skyward. "Brothers and sisters are getting fed up," my brother Ed grew fond of saying. "Sooner or later some shit's gonna explode." And it did.<br><br>Everybody had nicknames where we lived. People had two, three, sometimes four or five of them. If you didn't go to school or church with a kid, you could go your whole life without ever knowing what his real name was. A family on Greer Ave. had children known forever as Pumpkin, Pie, Buggy, and Cricket. Down the street from them was a kid called Boy, who was plenty nice as kids go. His real name was Dante, but not even his grandmother called him that. The kid on the corner of my block usually went by Man. Only occasionally was he called Roebuck Roundtree III. On the rest of our block we had two Peteys, a Tootie, a Decky, Big Wen and Big Hen, Throttles, and Choo-Choo. The tall, lean kid across the alley was named Lee but also answered to Bosco or Skillet.<br><br>The girls on our street had it just as bad. We had Twin, Boo, Sissy, Yogi, Baa-Baa, and another Tootie, this one a big-legged girl from Clarksdale. Her real name was Parthinias.<br><br>Ed, seventeen and universally recognized as the Coolest Dude on Earth, was the sole exception to the multiple nickname game. The other kids simply called him Ed, each of them pronouncing his name with an audible note of awe, as if they were saying Supreme Commander or Your Royal Highness.<br><br>During the summer of '67, Ed was going through changes, my mother would say with a hint of impatience. He tended to mumble on the phone or talk in this deep grunt punctuated by the occasional "Right on" or mysterious reference to "the people." His friends joined him in an elaborate ritual of respect each time they saw each other, a semi-embrace full of handshakes, finger locks, and elbow bumps. Just as dramatically, these same old friends, known in the recent past by such affectionate names as Knucklehead and Punk Ass, became Brothers, as in<br><br>"If Brother Charles calls, tell him I'm on my way."<br><br>"If that's Brother Vaughn, tell him he knows where to find me."<br><br>My other brother, Schomburg, was twelve years old and impossible to live with. His nicknames were all flattering, owing to his easygoing grace and charming good looks&#x2014;qualities that I couldn't bring myself to acknowledge, despite my best efforts. Girls called him Dimples. Boys called him Slick or Cool Breeze. Pop, who called me Hamburger, called him Superstar. Shom got that one from his coach and Little League teammates the night he hit three homers and gunned down the tying run at the plate from deep in right field. None of his admirers had any idea how obnoxious he could be in the privacy of his own room, which happened to be my room too.<br><br>There was no clearly marked border dividing our respective halves, but the contrast between the sides was so stark that a line may as well have been painted right down the middle. Shom liked to pretend that there was in fact a boundary, one made of dirt. There was no dust or debris on his side, little evidence that anyone even inhabited it. Everything reflected its owner's clearly neurotic obsession with neatness. All of his clothes were crisply folded and tucked tidily out of sight, save a red plaid robe hanging from a hook on the back of the door. Next to the door and leaning against the wall was a tall mirror, Shom's best friend.<br><br>He could stand in front of that thing for hours, it seemed to me. I suspected that he kept checking his reflection to reassure himself and smile away his worst fear: that his creamy brown complexion, dimples, and curls had just been part of a tantalizing dream. Like Ed, Shom was born handsome and appreciated the blessing. Still, he regarded the upkeep of his appearance as a sacred responsibility. Hence a good chunk of each day was spent maintaining his appearance, the better to solicit the compliments that he had come to expect as his birthright. He kept his comb and brush next to his bed, sometimes sleeping with them as if they were stuffed animals. I was never allowed to even handle his brush, and using it was out of the question. After all, science had yet to prove that nappy hair wasn't contagious.<br><br>I had no use for the mirror myself, certain that Shom's reflection would linger there to remind me tauntingly of all the things I lacked. I could let whole seasons go by without once glancing in that infernal glass.<br><br>It was my misfortune to be somewhat melanin-deprived just on the eve of the Black Is Beautiful revolution. I was yellow, beige on my best days, with orange lips that were big and swollen as Tweety Bird's beak. My hair was coppery with edges burned orange by the sun and locks coiled tight as bedsprings. My naps were stubborn yet soft as dust, although this latter quality didn't discourage the neighborhood kids from calling me Beanshots. No one really knew what beanshots were, but it was common playground parlance for extremely kinky hair. As a bonus, it was fun to pronounce and conveyed the unmistakable sting of insult.<br><br>My mother, Pristine, would never do such a dastardly thing as call me Beanshots, but she was clearly disappointed with my hair. She'd look at it with her lips pursed and her head turned slightly sideways, as if trying to figure out how things had gone wrong. My brother Ed had wavy hair that he cultivated by sleeping in a stocking cap and regularly applying generous doses of Murray's pomade. For all Shom's fussing with a comb and brush, all he really had to do was shake his head a little bit and every lock fell into place.<br><br>Mornings my mother met me with a sigh. She'd grip my chin firmly with one hand, then slap my face twice with the other to remind me to keep still. This was just before the hair-care market expanded to include Afro picks, and fine-tooth combs were absolute impossibilities, so she'd brush until her wrist got tired, then send me off to school. My scalp tingled and throbbed until lunchtime, when I would head home to eat and undergo the torture all over again. One of the reasons I liked summer so much was that Mom eased up on my hair, and the summer of '67 was no different. She'd let me go nappy for days at a time, and I'd be happy and headache-free.<br><br>Shom called me Beanshots only when other kids were around. In the privacy of our room, he preferred Pickle-Headed Pisspot (I tended to wet the bed) or his favorite, Bigheaded Redheaded Monkey. He denies it now, says I'm prone to remembering things that never happened. I know what I heard, despite what he says. Some stuff just sticks with you.<br><br>Of all my nicknames, my favorite was Sir Crispus, a noble-sounding designation better suited to a valiant knight than to an ugly duckling. The only person who called me that was Curly, the short, scary-looking blind man who ran the candy store on Vandeventer, between the dry cleaners and the shoeshine parlor. I have no idea how he got his nickname, for his hair was anything but. In fact, his wild salt-and-pepper mane even gave me a run for my money--and he had a beard to match. He wore big, red-tinted sunglasses over eyes that I imagined were blank and wildly unfocused, rolling uncontrollably in their sockets. Rumor had it that Curly had traded his eyes to our neighborhood undertaker in exchange for the money to open his business.<br><br>He looked like he slept in his clothes and probably often did, on the cot in the little room behind the store that he called home. Sometimes we woke him when we ran to his store at lunchtime, eager to stuff ourselves with Lemonheads, Sugar Babies, Slo Pokes, and Chick-O-Sticks before the second bell. He'd rise, groaning and scratching yet moving effortlessly from the back room to the counter, where we clamored frantically for our daily dose of sugar. We wondered how his fingers knew just where to find the brand of candy we demanded, how he made correct change without hesitation. More than a few kids agreed with Bumpy Decatur when he insisted that Curly wasn't blind at all but merely engaged in some complicated scam. Curly dubbed me Sir Crispus the Pure-Hearted when, against the advice of the two Peteys and Choo-Choo, I'd returned the extra Now and Laters he'd accidentally placed in my bag.<br><br>I saw more of Curly on days when I hung out with Father Time, whose grandparents ran the cleaners next door to the candy shop. Father Time, christened Brian by his unwitting parents, was so nicknamed because of the slow way he walked and talked. We'd take turns tossing a rubber ball against the wall of the cleaners while his grandfather Mr. Kirkwood kept an eye on us. I loved to watch the old man operate his big steam press, the way he ignored the massive cloud of mist that seemed to always encircle his head. When business was lagging Curly would sit on the stoop behind his store and listen to records. Usually it was the same one: "I'd Rather Go Blind." He'd nod his head behind his red shades, a cigarette turning to ash between his bony fingers. "Etta James," he'd say. "She ain't got no idea."<br><br>There was a calendar on Curly's wall with a naked woman on it. Father Time and I had made it our mission to tiptoe past the nodding Curly and make out her mysterious curves in the dim recesses of his room. But every time we tried, we would hear, "Shame on you, Sir Crispus," as if he was reading my mind. "Sneaking a peek at another man's woman."<br><br>"Sorry," I'd apologize. "You mean she's&#x2014;?"<br><br>"That's right. Miss June. Used to be mine, for sure. And once you been Curly's, you cain't be nobody else's. Sir Crispus, you too young to even know what I'm talking about."<br><br>For a long time we kids used to wonder where Curly hid his dog during the day. Father Time and I never saw any evidence of the huge beast that we knew lurked somewhere in Curly's tiny lair, along with his cot, his calendar, and his record player. At night, however, the dog's loud, piercing wails could be heard as far away as Natural Bridge Boulevard, four blocks distant.<br><br>One night I asked my dad if he'd ever seen Curly's dog.<br><br>"What dog?"<br><br>"The one that's howling right now. Don't you hear it?"<br><br>My mom's mom, who preferred to be called Big Mama but whom I secretly nicknamed the Grandmother, was visiting from her home down the block. She snorted.<br><br>"That's an animal all right," she said, "but it's not a dog."<br><br>"Be nice, Big Mama," Mom cautioned.<br><br>The Grandmother waved her hand. "Just telling it like it is."<br><br>"That's Curly you hear," Dad explained. "Sometimes he drinks too much rotgut and it forces all his anger out."<br><br>"His gut isn't the only thing that's rotting," the Grandmother said. "His soul can't be far behind."<br><br>I had no worries about Curly's soul. Only a good man could have the uncanny ability to emerge from his storefront just when Bumpy Decatur and his brothers were about to shake us down for our candy money. Only a good man would forbid the other kids to call me Beanshots in his presence. "That's Sir Crispus," he'd declare. "He's got history in his name. You little whippersnappers need to get some respect."<br><br>I sensed instinctively that he was not a corrupt man, merely a sad one. His tale, which Father Time and I caught in whiskey-soaked fragments muttered between verses of Etta James, was too involved for a boy of nine to get his imagination around. Even so, I knew it involved missed opportunities, a beautiful woman, and a broken heart. What more was there to know?<br><br>One night in early June, Curly's mysterious past was consigned to smoke and ashes forever.<br><br>Shom and I were already bathed and in our pajamas, watching Mr. Terrific, when the quiet of evening gave way to the sound of shattering glass. Shouts, curses, and sirens followed. My father leaned out of my parents' bedroom window on the second floor. "Someone's down," my father said. "A lot of people are gathering on the corner. Maybe I--"<br><br>"Maybe you should shut that window and sit down," my mother said. "Nothing but trouble out there."<br><br>There was a knock at the door. My father went down to answer it, my mother close at his heels. Shom and I peeked through the upstairs banister. "It's Collins," Pop said. He opened the door.<br><br>Mr. Collins, our next-door neighbor, skipped his usual greetings.<br><br>"Reuben, let's go down to the corner," he said.<br><br>"Why's that?"<br><br>Mr. Collins hesitated, then shot a quick glance at my mother before returning his gaze to Pop. "Is Ed here?"<br><br>Pristine gasped. My father looked at her, and then rushed past Mr. Collins. Our neighbor looked apologetically at my mom. "Don't worry," he said. He left and shut the door.<br><br>"Lord have mercy," my mother whispered. She called Shom and me and gathered us in her arms.<br><br>We huddled in silence while confusion swirled loudly outside. Mr. Terrific went off. I wanted to get up and change the channel to NBC because it was time for my favorite show, Captain Nice. I could almost hear its opening theme: "That's no ordinary nut, boy, that's Captain Nice!"<br><br>The door swung open. Ed stepped in, followed by my dad. Ed had a small cut on his forehead. My mother ran to him, her arms spread wide.<br><br>"Baby," she said.<br><br>Ed held her. "I'm fine, Mom. I'm fine."<br><br>She stared at his wound. "Did the police do that?"<br><br>"No, Mom. The people were throwing all kinds of stuff out there. I think some glass caught me." To my eyes Ed looked changed, battle-scarred somehow. I wondered if a piece of glass could make so much difference.<br><br>"It was just a handful of folks making a whole lotta fuss," my dad said. "It's over, at least for now. The police are gone. They've done enough damage tonight."<br><br>"Jesus, Ed," Mom said. "Mr. Collins came by and told us you were out there. I was so afraid."<br><br>Dad put his hand on Ed's shoulder.</p><h2>Touch the Devil</h2><p>Retired agent Liam Devlin is forced to undertake a deadly mission that involves British and Soviet intelligence, hired killer Martin Brosnan, and combat photographer Anne-Marie Audin</p><p>Since The Eagle Has Landed&#x2015;one of the biggest-selling thrillers of all time&#x2015;every novel Jack Higgins has written has become an international bestseller.

M. Tadiar offers a new paradigm for understanding politics and globalization. Her analysis illuminates both the power of Filipino subaltern experience to shape social and economic realities and the critical role of the nation&#x2019;s writers and poets in that process. Through close readings of poems, short stories, and novels brought into conversation with scholarship in anthropology, sociology, politics, and economics, Tadiar demonstrates how the devalued experiences of the Philippines&#x2019; vast subaltern populations&#x2014;experiences that &#x201c;fall away&#x201d; from the attention of mainstream and progressive accounts of the global capitalist present&#x2014;help to create the material conditions of social life that feminists, urban activists, and revolutionaries seek to transform. Reading these &#x201c;fallout&#x201d; experiences as vital yet overlooked forms of political agency, Tadiar offers a new and provocative analysis of the unrecognized productive forces at work in global trends such as the growth of migrant domestic labor, the emergence of postcolonial &#x201c;civil society,&#x201d; and the &#x201c;democratization&#x201d; of formerly authoritarian nations.<p></p><p>Tadiar treats the historical experiences articulated in feminist, urban protest, and revolutionary literatures of the 1960s&#x2013;90s as &#x201c;cultural software&#x201d; for the transformation of dominant social relations. She considers feminist literature in relation to the feminization of labor in the 1970s, when between 300,000 and 500,000 prostitutes were working in the areas around U.S. military bases, and in the 1980s and 1990s, when more than five million Filipinas left the country to toil as maids, nannies, nurses, and sex workers. She reads urban protest literature in relation to authoritarian modernization and crony capitalism, and she reevaluates revolutionary literature&#x2019;s constructions of the heroic revolutionary subject and the messianic masses, probing these social movements&#x2019; unexhausted cultural resources for radical change.</p></p><p>&#34;The study of the Philippines, one of Europe&#39;s earliest and the US&#39;s first colonies, obliges the rethinking of colonial histories. In the growing body of crucial work on the Philippines, Neferti X. M. Tadiar&#39;s &#34;Things Fall Away&#34; is indispensable reading, a compelling rethinking of both postcolonial theory and transnational feminism. A richly poetic lament for the things that fall away, it dares still to descry in cast-aside affect and in occluded practices resources for the difficult labor of living otherwise.&#34;--David Lloyd, author of &#34;Irish Times: Temporalities of Modernity&#34;<p>Neferti X.

Or Amelia&#39;s nemesis! A masked stranger offers to reveal an Egyptian queens&#39; lost tomb - and Amelia Peabody and her irascible archaeologist husband Emerson are intrigued, to say the least. When the guide mysteriously disappears before he can tell them his secret, the Peabody-Emersons sail to Thebes to follow his trail, helped - and hampered - by their teenage son Rameses, and beautiful ward Nefret. Before the sands of time shift very far, all of them will be risking their lives foiling murderers, kidnappers, grave robbers, and ancient curses. Off once again on a rollicking adventure involving archaeology, murderers, kidnappers, grave robbers and ancient curses. And the hippopotamus Pool? It&#39;s a legend of war and wits that Amelia is translating, one that alerts her to a hippo of a different type - a nefarious, overweight art dealer who is on course to become her new arch-enemy!</p><p>What could be more intriguing to Amelia Peabody and her irresistible, irascible husband, Emerson (&#34;the Father of Curses&#34;), than meeting a masked stranger who offers to show them an Egyptian queen&#39;s lost tomb? The mysterious disappearance of that midnight visitor before he can disclose the secret! Thus begins Amelia&#39;s newest adventure along the Nile. Helped, or hampered, by two teenagers, their son, Ramses, and their beautiful ward, Nefret, the Emersons set sail for Thebes to find the hidden tomb of Queen Tetisheri. With them is a timid (or is she?) governess named Miss Marmaduke. Soon to join the expedition are Amelia&#39;s sister- and brother-in-law, Evelyn and Walter, whose marriage is going through a rocky patch. As usual, archaeology is only one of Amelia&#39;s concerns, as the Emersons encounter murderers, kidnappers, grave robbers and ancient Egyptian curses. The tomb, of course, will hold a stunning surprise. And the Hippopotamus Pool? It&#39;s an ancient Egyptian story of war and wits that Amelia is translating... and that alerts her to a hippo of a different stripe: a nefarious, overweight art dealer who may become her next archenemy. Or perhaps not - for another nemesis is lurking under the Saharan sun, a master of disguises, a caliph of crime, a veritable vizier of villainy.

He was born in 1920 in Andernach, Germany, to an American soldier father and a German mother, and brought to the United States at the age of two. He was raised in Los Angeles and lived there for over fifty years. He died in San Pedro, California, on March 9, 1994, at the age of seventy-three, shortly after completing his last novel,&nbsp;<em>Pulp</em>.</p><p><strong>Abel Debritto</strong>, a former Fulbright scholar and current Marie Curie fellow, works in the digital humanities. He is the author of&nbsp;<em>Charles Bukowski, King of the Underground</em>, and the editor of the Bukowski collections&nbsp;<em>On Writing</em>,&nbsp;<em>On Cats</em>, and&nbsp;<em>On Love</em>.</p>Bukowski's unmistakable persona&#x2014;an ex-down-and-outer who wrote of racetracks, booze and loneliness in ragged, self-confident, free verse&#x2014;made him one of the country's most popular poets long before he died in 1994; 11 years later, death has not slowed down his production. This ninth posthumous volume of new verse (following <i>Slouching Toward Nirvana</i> closely) gathers everything devotees cherish and expect: horses and bets, lousy SROs, unreliable women, sexual conquests, sexual disgust, barbs at highbrow rivals, advice to so-called losers (as he once was) to have confidence in themselves (as he did) and a befuddled acceptance of late fame. "Welcome to my wormy hell," the first line in the volume reads, and similar notes of not-quite-comic self-pity occur throughout, as when "the x-bum" reminds himself "that there was no bottom to life." These poems differ little from those in his other late volumes and may not win him many new fans: given the size of his existing following, however, this book won't need new ones. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lovecraft</p><p>Return to Arkham and behold the Old Gods in all their horrific darkness. Eighteen authors take a stab at interpreting the mythos of H.P. Lovecraft, master of a compelling style and setting so unique it has spawned a name--Lovecraftian--describing the unique blend of science fiction, fantasy, and horror that made him famous. From Gene Wolfe's creepy outer-space tale "The Other Dead Man" to Stephen King's "Crouch End," where Cthulhu himself would feel right at home, these stories are chillingly inspired by Lovecraft's style and milieu. Other highlights are stories by Fritz Lieber, Harlan Ellison, and Nancy A. Collins. Settings vary from the Roman Empire to a slightly... different... New England inhabited with alien terrors. Not familiar with H.P. Lovecraft? These stories will make you want to discover his classic fiction, and there's a wonderful introduction to help you understand the man behind the mythos. This is extradimensionally weird fun. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>H. P. Lovecraft's place in the annals of horror fiction is permanent. His tales of ancient evils including the horrible occult spellbook, the <i>Necronomicon</i>, and the Great Old Ones--huge, malevolent extraterrestrials who have menaced humanity since time immemorial--are pillars of the genre. Editor Turner presents 18 short stories directly influenced by HPL; true to their inspiration, they vary greatly in quality, from Peter Tremayne's rather clumsy "Daoine Domhain" to Fritz Lieber's wonderfully wrought "A Bit of the Dark World." The majority, however, are well enough written and should deliver a delicious shiver to most readers. Other entries are "Crouch End" by Stephen King, in which a tourist disappears in a strange little English village; "The Perseids" by Robert Charles Wilson, which describes a curious human evolutionary utility; and a parody of HPL's life by Ron Goulart. <i>Eric Robbins</i></p><h2>The Lesser Bohemians: A Novel</h2><p><b>Winner of the James Tait Black Prize for Fiction<br>Shortlisted for the International Dublin Literary Award<br>Shortlisted for the 2016 Goldsmiths Prize <br>Shortlisted for the 2016 Bord G�is Energy Irish Book Awards Eason Novel of the Year<br><br>The breathtaking new novel from Eimear McBride, about an extraordinary, all-consuming love affair</b><br><br>Eimear McBride&#x2019;s debut novel A GIRL IS A HALF-FORMED THING was published in 2013 to an avalanche of praise: nominated for a host of literary awards, winner of the Bailey&#x2019;s Women&#x2019;s Prize for Fiction and the inaugural Goldsmith&#x2019;s Prize, declared by <i>Vanity Fair</i> to be "One of the most groundbreaking pieces of literature to come from Ireland, or anywhere, in recent years," McBride&#x2019;s bold, wholly original prose immediately established her as a literary force.

You're always in safe hands with the wonderful Stephen Thorne. His execution of Brother Cadfael is near perfection, injecting into the character all the intelligence and compassion that make him such a well-loved figure in crime fiction. After a near-fatal accident, Brother Haluin feels his sins heavy upon his soul and embarks, with the help of Cadfael, on a pilgrimage of atonement. Along the way old deceits and betrayals come to light, as well as another tragedy in the making that Brother Cadfael must put right. Altogether a good bet.

It was, by conservative estimate, one of the grandest hikes in American history. With no reason to be modest, Lummis called his "unpretentious" account of it "the wayside notes of a happy vagabonding."</p><p>Charles F. Lummis, an editor and ethnologist who wrote successfully for a broad audience, is best remembered for his books about the early legendary history of New Mexico and about the southwestern Indians, including <i>The Land of Poco Tiempo</i> (1893) and <i>Mesa, Ca�on and Pueblo</i> (1925). His 1891 collection of <i>Pueblo folklore</i>, <i>Pueblo Indian Folk-Stories</i>, is also a Bison Book."Lummis walked from Ohio to California in 1884, and in the journal he published in 1892 he calls his saga 'the simple story of joy on legs.'

Money exerts a deep emotional influence on who we are and what we tell ourselves we can never have. Our long unwillingness to understand the emotional and spiritual effects of money on us is at the heart of why we have come to know the price of everything, and the value of nothing. Money has everything to do with the pursuit of an idealistic life, while at the same time, it is at the root of our daily frustrations. On a social level, money has a profound impact on the price of progress. Needleman shows how money slowly began to haunt us, from the invention of coins in Biblical times (when money was created to rescue the community good, not for self gain), through its hypnotic appeal in our money-obsessed era. This is a remarkable book that combines myth and psychology, the poetry of the Sufis and the wisdom of King Solomon, along with Jacob Needleman&#39;s searching of his own soul and his culture to explain how money can become a unique means of self-knowledge. As part of the Currency paperback line, it includes a &#34;User&#39;s Guide&#34; an introduction and discussion guide created for the paperback by the author -- to help readers make practical use of the book&#39;s ideas.</p><p><b>Jacob Needleman</b> is professor of philosophy at San Francisco State University. He is the author of many bestselling books, including, most recently,&nbsp;<i>A Little Book on Love.</i>In this philosophical discussion of the meaning of money in one&#39;s life, Needleman looks at all aspects of money and how it affects people. From philosophical and religious texts, as well as real-life dilemmas, he draws examples of what money is and how it has changed its place in society. Needleman presents his subject in an informal manner, in a mixture of lecture and didactic stories that are similar to the works of Joseph Campbell. This style allows listeners to ponder their own feelings about money and life while following well-thought-out, if meandering, suppositions. M.B.K.

With his wife and co-captain, he splits his time between Alaska and their cruising sailboat, currently in Central America.<strong>Praise for <em>And Soon I Heard a Roaring Wind</em></strong><br><br><strong>One of <em>USA Today's</em> "NEW AND NOTEWORTHY" Selections</strong><br><br>"The wind is always changeable, whether it's a brisk nor'easter or the shifting tempests of intellectual history. <i>And Soon I Heard Roaring Wind</i> proves that Bill Streever is a master at navigating both."&#x2015;<b><i>Sam Kean, author of <i>The Disappearing Spoon</i></i></b><br><br>"Science, history, and personal adventure come together in a wild and witty exploration of wind. When Streever deals with a natural phenomenon, he does so with aplomb...[he] has a knack for blending his research and personal experience into an easy-to-read account that is hard to put down."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Kirkus Reviews </em>(starred review)</i></b><br><br>"Streever covers the science of wind and weather and the history of weather forecasting in an authoritative, well-researched, and engrossing text.... A riveting, detailed look at the power of wind, along with the pleasures and perils of sailing....This page-turning work of narrative nonfiction will appeal to readers interested in the history of science, the history and science of meteorology, the science of wind, and memoirs of life at sea."&#x2015;<b><i>Sue O'Brien, <em>Library Journal</em></i></b><br><br>"Streever's ability to make complex concepts easy to understand while still capturing the awe and mystery of nature is spot-on."&#x2015;<b><i>Sarah Grant, <em>Booklist</em></i></b><br><br>"Clear prose animated by deadpan humor and enthusiasm for all things meteorological.... Streever absorbingly explains the processes that make air move...."&#x2015;<b><i><em>Publishers Weekly</em></i></b><br><br>"Streever intertwines scientific histories in terms palatable even for laymen. When the going gets technical, Streever is there with an analogy to clarify....He brings the reader an understanding of what's important [about wind, and] along the way, Streever sprinkles in surprises and makes historical connections."&#x2015;<b><i>John B. Saul, <em>Seattle Times Sunday</em></i></b><br><br>Although "few things in life are more ubiquitous than wind," Streever argues that it's "a problem not only for scientists but for the global economy."&#x2015;<b><i>Sarah Begley, <em>Time Magazine</em></i></b><br><br>"Rather than simply being a book about the wind, this is more of a journey through our understanding of weather and our attempts to try to predict what the skies will do...Steever intersperses this historical journey of weather prediction with personal experiences gained during a 43-day journey by sailboat around the Gulf of Mexico, giving readers a feel of the real world impact of winds and storms."&#x2015;<b><i>Kit Gillet, <em>Geographical</em></i></b><br><br>"Streever's voyage under sail from Texas to Guatemala [gives] a breezy immediacy to the story of how we learned to decode 'moving air.'"&#x2015;<b><i>Barbara Kiser, <em>Nature Magazine</em></i></b><br><br>"A biologist and nature writer, Streever approaches meteorology in a way that brings to mind John McPhee's writings about geology, belaboring the text with no more scientific jargon than necessary....This book chronicles key discoveries in meteorology, [and Streever's] gale-force inquiry leads to some fascinating asides....As he unfurls <i>Rocinante's</i> sails, he muses on the development of wind-powered boats, he sails past Portuguese man-of-wars, and through all of this, we meet a motley crew of characters-theorists, philosophers, scientists, inventors, mathematicians-who puzzled and often disagreed bitterly as they sailed into the unknown mysteries of our atmosphere."&#x2015;<b><i>Kim Cross, <em>The Dallas Morning News</em></i></b></p><h2>The Eyes of the Killer Robot</h2><p>Thirteen-year-old Johnny Dixon finds himself in danger when a maniacol wizard invents a robot that can only by activated by human eyes</p><p><b>John Anthony Bellairs</b>&nbsp;(1938 1991) is an award-winning American author, perhaps best known for his&nbsp;fantasy&nbsp;novel&nbsp;The Face in the Frost.&nbsp;He is also the author of many&nbsp;gothic&nbsp;mystery&nbsp;novels for children and young adults, including The House with a Clock in its Walls (which received both the New York Times Outstanding Book of Award and the American Library Association Children's Books of International Interest Award), The Lamp from the Warlock&#x2019;s Tomb (which won the Edgar Allen Poe Award), and The Specter from the Magician&#x2019;s Museum (which won the New York Public Library "Best Books for the Teen Age" Award.<br> &nbsp;<br>Grade 5-8 Johnny Dixon and Professor Childermass, along with their friend Byron "Fergie" Ferguson, are back in another imaginative chiller. Here the three are pitted against Evaristus Sloane, an insane wizard and inventor. But even more frightening than Sloane is a robot he invented some 50 years before. The robot was built to look like a baseball player and to pitch balls, but the Professor, Johnny, and Fergie discover a much darker side to the mechanism. After finding the dismantled robot in an abandoned house, the Professor reassembles it. But after placing its eyes back in the empty sockets, the Professor realizes too late that he has resurrected a killer machine. Not only must the robot be stopped but also its mad inventor before Johnny loses his eyes and his life to a terrifying scheme. As always, Bellairs skillfully runs a current of evil just beneath the surface of the commonplace. The supernatural is mixed with the ordinary so effortlessly and so naturally as to make even the most bizarre people and situations seem possible in a very unsettling way. A unique plot, marvelous characters, and non-stop suspense make for deliciously wicked fun.

Yikes! It's two of Santa's elves who are Christmas Eve stowaways. Beloved illustrator Jan Brett's version of <i>The Night Before Christmas</i> lets these two mischievous elves add their rambunctious spirit to this familiar 1823 rhyming story. Here, Santa and his reindeer land on the snowy roof of a Victorian mansion in New England. While Santa delivers the toys inside, the elves and the reindeer frolic around the lawn, as a pig (earmarked for a girl named Jan) and a few alphabet blocks spill out of sacks into the snow. Santa swiftly reins in the mischief-makers and "away they all flew like the down on a thistle." Brett's richly illustrated borders are lavishly decorated with antique toys, ornaments, and sweet treats, all surrounded with twisting golden ribbons. They also give us a window on the mansion's inhabitants, including the children watching Santa's departure in awe. A sugarplum of a Christmas story, just right for a reading before "a long winter's nap." (Click to see a sample spread. Illustrations �1998 by Jan Brett. Published by G.P.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.Tennyson&#39;s friend Arthur Henry Hallam recognized early his precision and delicacy of language, and believed him &#34;promising fair to be the greatest poet of our generation, perhaps our century.&#34; The publication of In Memoriam on this friend&#39;s death established Tennyson&#39;s reputation, which Maud (1855) and Idylls of the King (1859) fortified.</p><h2>Leave It to Psmith</h2><p>A debononair young Englishman, Psmith (&#x201c;the p is silent, as in phthisis, psychic, and ptarmigan&#x201d;) has quit the fish business, &#x201c;even though there is money in fish,&#x201d; and decided to support himself by doing anything that he is hired to do by anyone.

In a rapturous review on the front page of The New York Times, Michael Kimmelman says that it gives us a sublime painter whose achievement places him in the company of artists who reveal the world with new vision.&nbsp;This catalogue&nbsp;offers a permanent record of this magnificent art exhibition.&nbsp;Claude Monet is one of the most beloved painters in the history of art. His work appeals both to the broad general public and to artists, who are moved and challenged by his achievement over a working life that spanned six decades. With more than 300 illustrations of Monet&#x20ac;&#x2122;s greatest works and accessible essays by leading art historians, this lush volume offers a vivid new perspective on the artist and his work.&nbsp;Praise for Monet:"The biggest art spectacle in Europe this fall . . .&nbsp;it is, b</p><p><p>Joseph Baillo is a principal at Wildenstein &amp; Co., Laurence Bertrand-Dorl�ac is a professor at the Institut des Sciences Politiques de Paris, John House is Walter H. Annenberg Professor at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London, Laurence Madeline, Sylvie Patin, Sylvie Patry, and Anne Roquebert are curators at the Mus�e d&#x2019;Orsay, Paris, and Richard Thompson is a professor at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>"What would be the point of a retrospective if it were not an invitation to take a fresh look?" asks Guy Cogeval, president of Paris's Orsay and Orangerie museums in this thematically organized and splendidly illustrated catalogue of the first major Monet retrospective in 15 years (currently on exhibit in Paris). The catalogue provides inventive, insightful perspectives on the artist's work and life by noted art historians and Orsay curators. House argues, for instance, that Monet's emphasis on his "uniquely personal, subjective sensation" unified his diverse subject matter. A fascinating essay links Monet's last works with Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West; another is an incisive study of "reproduction" and "oeuvre" in the works of Monet and Roy Lichtenstein. And there is a beautifully illustrated exploration of the origin and development of his "series" process. This visually stunning and analytically innovative collection ends with a thoughtful photo essay on Monet "the man," by art critic Philippe Piguet, who is a direct descendant of the artist. 300 color illus.

I'm Trapped in Obedience School) covers all the bases in his latest middle-grade caper, whose winning elements include fully formed characters, snappy, credible dialogue and a quick-moving plot that tackles real-life issues with a light touch. Baseball fanatics, Ian and his friends would happily spend every afternoon on the diamond, but things get in the way: ordinarily cheerful Jenny begins refuting reasonable calls against her, runs off the field when she doesn't get her way and gradually becomes a no-show. On some days a group of high school tough guys, among them Jenny's stepbrother, throws rocks at the youngsters and forces them to abandon their games. Ian, an unusually level-headed and thoughtful 11-year-old, reaches out to the troubled Jenny and her stepbrother with the help of his perceptive mother who, the boy muses, sometimes would "ask just enough questions to get you thinking about something. Then she'd leave you to figure out the rest on your own." Strasser's solid story should score points with girls as well as boys, especially those more accustomed to holding a baseball glove than a book.

First serial, Talk.</p><p>Karl Marx, whose influence on modern times has been compared to that of Jesus Christ, spent most of his lifetime in obscurity. Penniless, exiled in London, estranged from relations, and on the run from most of the police forces of Europe, his ambitions as a revolutionary were frequently thwarted, and his major writings on politics and economics remained unpublished (in some cases until after the Second World War). He has not lacked biographers, but even the most distinguished have been more interested in the evolution of his ideas than any other aspect of his life. Francis Wheen's fresh, lively, and moving biography of Marx considers the whole man--brain, beard, and the rest of his body. Unencumbered by ideological point scoring, this is a very readable, humorous, and sympathetic account. Wheen has an ear for juicy gossip and an eye for original detail. Marx comes across as a hell-raising bohemian, an intellectual bully, and a perceptive critic of capitalist chaos, but also a family man of Victorian conformity (personally vetting his daughters' suitors), Victorian ailments (carbuncles above all), and Victorian weaknesses (notably alcohol, tobacco, and, on occasion, his housekeeper). But there is great pathos, too, as Marx witnessed the deaths of four of his six children.

As the plane&#x2019;s engines rev she breathes a sigh of relief, lights a cigarette and slips off her wig revealing a tangle of fluffy blonde curls. Marilyn Monroe was leaving Hollywood behind, and along with it a failed marriage and a frustrating career. She needed a break from the scrutiny and insanity of LA. She needed Manhattan.</p><p> In Manhattan, the most famous woman in the world can wander the streets unbothered, spend hours at the Met getting lost in art, and afternoons buried in the stacks of the Strand. Marilyn begins to live a life of the mind in New York; she dates Arthur Miller, dances with Truman Capote and drinks with Carson McCullers. Even though she had never lived there before, in New York, Marilyn is home.</p><p>In <i>Marilyn in Manhattan</i>, the iconic blonde bombshell is not only happy, but successful. She breaks her contract with Fox Studios to form her own production company, a groundbreaking move that makes her the highest paid actress in history and revolutionizes the entertainment industry. A true love letter to Marilyn, and a joyous portrait of a city bursting with life and art, <i>Marilyn in Manhattan</i> is a beautifully written, lively look at two American treasures: New York and Marilyn Monroe, and sheds new light on one of our most enduring icons.</p></p><p>Elizabeth Winder is the author of PAIN, PARTIES, WORK: Sylvia Plath in New York, Summer 1953.

For thirty years she swims the oceans, wandering thousands of miles as she searches for food. Until, one summer night, she lands on a beach to lay her eggs&#x2014;the very same beach where she herself was born. Nicola Davies's lyrical text offers fascinating information about the journey of the tiny, endangered loggerhead, while charming paintings by Jane Chapman vivdly illustrate one turtle's journey.</p><p>Nicola Davies has loved sea turtles ever since she first saw one in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Nicola Davies is also the author of BIG BLUE WHALE, BAT LOVES THE NIGHT, and WILD ABOUT DOLPHINS.<br><br>Jane Chapman also loves sea turtles and has wanted to paint them for ages. Her other books for children include ONE DUCK STUCK by Phyllis Root and THE EMPEROR'S EGG by Martin Jenkins, a National Science Teachers Association - Children's Book Council Outstanding Science Trade Book for Children.K-Gr 2-This nicely developed picture-book introduction to the loggerhead turtle sketches the life experiences of a typical female through text and broad acrylic views. The author exhibits a flair for alliteration and imagery in her descriptive narrative about this sea animal: "Just beneath the surface is a tangle of weed and driftwood where tiny creatures cling. This is the nursery of a sea turtle." Several pages follow the creature's early period and departure for the larger sea, and then the years of growth and travel are skimmed until her eventual return to the beach of her birth to lay her own eggs. On many pages curving lines of smaller type add bits of explanation, augmenting the story line. The double-spread paintings, occasionally alternating with smaller pictures set on aqua pages, focus on the turtle, with a few water plants suggesting underwater detail. A fine bed of blue crabs on which the turtle feasts is the only view of other animals sharing the ocean habitat until a concluding beach scenario where gulls and crabs threaten the newly hatched turtles who are starting the cycle anew. A very brief introduction identifies this turtle as a loggerhead. Gail Gibbons's Sea Turtles (Holiday, 1995) and Brenda Guiberson's Into the Sea (Holt, l995) offer young readers more information on this interesting animal. Broadly sketched in good language and pictures for read-aloud sharing, Davies's title will be enjoyed as a glimpse into the ways of the remarkable giant sea turtles.<p></p><p><i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>In the Heart of the Village: The World of the Indian Banyan Tree (Tree Tales)</h2><p>Lyrical prose and vivid watercolor paintings capture the world of the ancient banyan tree at the center of a small Indian village and the people and wildlife that flourish beneath and within its branches.</p><p>see In the Heart of the Village (pb)In the ancient times, Nirantali, the first mother of the earth, was sent by the gods to create the world.

Her heart beats faster and she darts a look over her shoulder. Perhaps she feels a sense of foreboding of what&#x2019;s to come as her day progresses.<br>In spite of the television studio&#x2019;s heat, Penelope&#x2019;s face feels chilled. Maybe the sensation is left over from her time in makeup when the cold powder puff was pressed to her skin and the peace-dove hair clip was taken out so they could rub in the mousse that would make her hair fall in serpentine locks.<br>Penelope Fernandez is the spokesperson for the Swedish Peace and Reconciliation Society. Silently, she is being ushered into the newsroom and to her spotlighted seat across from Pontus Salman, CEO of the armaments manufacturer Silencia Defense AB. The news anchor Stefanie von Sydow is narrating a report on all the layoffs resulting from the purchase of the Bofors Corporation by British BAE Systems Limited. Then she turns to Penelope.<br>&#x201c;Penelope Fernandez, in several public debates you have been critical of the management of Swedish arms exports. In fact, you recently compared it to the French Angola-gate scandal. There, highly placed politicians and businessmen were prosecuted for bribery and weapons smuggling and given long prison sentences. But here in Sweden? We really haven&#x2019;t seen this, have we?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, you can interpret this in two ways,&#x201d; replies Penelope. &#x201c;Either our politicians behave differently or our justice system works differently.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know very well,&#x201d; begins Pontus Salman, &#x201c;that we have a long tradition of&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;According to Swedish law,&#x201d; Penelope says, &#x201c;all manufacture and export of armaments are illegal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wrong, of course,&#x201d; says Salman.<br>&#x201c;Paragraphs 3 and 6 of the Military Equipment Act,&#x201d; Penelope points out with precision.<br>&#x201c;We at Silencia Defense have already gotten a positive preliminary decision.&#x201d; Salman smiles.<br>&#x201c;Otherwise this would be a case of major weapons crimes and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But, we <i>do</i> have permission.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget the rationale for armaments&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just a moment, Penelope.&#x201d; Stefanie von Sydow stops her and nods to Pontus Salman, who&#x2019;s lifted his hand to signal that he wasn&#x2019;t finished.<br>&#x201c;All business transactions are reviewed in advance,&#x201d; he explains. &#x201c;Either directly by the government or by the National Inspectorate of Strategic Products, if you know what that is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;France has similar regulations,&#x201d; says Penelope. &#x201c;And yet military equipment worth eight million Swedish crowns landed in Angola despite the UN weapons embargo and in spite of a completely binding prohibition&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not talking about France, we&#x2019;re talking about Sweden.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know that people want to keep their jobs, but I still would like to hear how you can explain the export of enormous amounts of ammunition to Kenya? It&#x2019;s a country that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have no proof,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Nothing. Not one shred. Or do you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, I cannot&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have no concrete evidence?&#x201d; asks Stefanie von Sydow.<br>&#x201c;No, but I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then I think I&#x2019;m owed an apology,&#x201d; says Pontus Salman.<br>Penelope stares him in the eyes, her anger and frustration boiling up, but she tamps it down, stays silent. Pontus Salman smiles smugly and begins to talk about Silencia Defense&#x2019;s factory in Trollh�ttan. Two hundred new jobs were created when they were given permission to start production, he says. He speaks slowly and in elaborate detail, deftly truncating the time left for his opponent.<br>As Penelope listens, she forces aside her anger by focusing on other matters. Soon, very soon, she and Bj�rn will board his boat. They&#x2019;ll make up the arrow-shaped bed in the forecabin and fill the refrigerator and tiny freezer with treats. She conjures up the frosted schnapps glasses, and the platter of marinated herring, mustard herring, soused herring, fresh potatoes, boiled eggs, and hardtack. After they anchor at a tiny island in the archipelago, they&#x2019;ll set the table on the afterdeck and sit there eating in the evening sun for hours.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Penelope Fernandez walks out of the Swedish Television building and heads toward Valhallav�gen. She wasted two hours waiting for a slot in another morning program before the producer finally told her she&#x2019;d been bumped by a segment on quick tips for a summer tummy. Far away, on the fields of G�rdet, she can make out the colorful tents of Circus Maximus and the little forms of two elephants, probably very large. One raises his trunk high in the air.<br>Penelope is only twenty-four years old. She has curly black hair cut to her shoulders, and a tiny crucifix, a confirmation present, glitters from a silver chain around her neck. Her skin is the soft golden color of virgin olive oil or honey, as a boy in high school said during a project where the students were supposed to describe one another. Her eyes are large and serious. More than once, she&#x2019;s heard herself described as looking like Sophia Loren.<br>Penelope pulls out her cell phone to let Bj�rn know she&#x2019;s on her way. She&#x2019;ll be taking the subway from Karlaplan station.<br>&#x201c;Penny? Is something wrong?&#x201d; Bj�rn sounds rushed.<br>&#x201c;No, why do you ask?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s set. I left a message on your machine. You&#x2019;re all that&#x2019;s missing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No need to stress, then, right?&#x201d;<br>As Penelope takes the steep escalator down to the subway platform, her heart begins to beat uneasily. She closes her eyes. The escalator sinks downward, seeming to shrink as the air becomes cooler and cooler.<br>Penelope Fernandez comes from La Libertad, one of the largest provinces in El Salvador. She was born in a jail cell, her mother attended by fifteen female prisoners doing their best as midwives. There was a civil war going on, and Claudia Fernandez, a doctor and activist, had landed in the regime&#x2019;s infamous prison for encouraging the indigenous population to form unions.<br>Penelope opens her eyes as she reaches the platform. Her claustrophobic feeling has passed. She thinks about Bj�rn waiting for her at the motorboat club on L�ngholmen. She loves skinny-dipping from his boat, diving straight into the water, seeing nothing but sea and sky.<br>She steps onto the subway, which rumbles on, gently swaying, until it breaks out into the open as it reaches the station at Gamla Stan and sunlight streams in through the windows.<br>Like her mother, Penelope is an activist and her passionate opposition to war and violence led her to get her master&#x2019;s in political science at Uppsala University with a specialty in peace and conflict resolution. She&#x2019;s worked for the French aid organization Action Contre la Faim in Darfur, southern Sudan, with Jane Oduya, and her article for <i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, on the women of the refugee camp and their struggles to regain normalcy after every attack, brought broad recognition. Two years ago, she followed Frida Blom as the spokesperson for the Swedish Peace and Reconciliation Society.<br>Leaving the subway at the Hornstull station, Penelope feels uneasy again, extremely uneasy, without knowing why. She runs down the hill to S�der M�larstrand, then walks quickly over the bridge to L�ngholmen and follows the road to the small harbor. The dust she kicks up from the gravel creates a haze in the still air.<br>Bj�rn&#x2019;s boat is in the shade directly underneath V�ster Bridge. The movement of the water dapples the gray girders with a network of light.<br>Penelope spots Bj�rn on the afterdeck. He&#x2019;s got on his cowboy hat, and he stands stock-still, shoulders bent, with his arms wrapped closely about him. Sticking two fingers in her mouth, she lets loose a whistle, startling him, and he turns toward her with a face naked with fear. And it&#x2019;s still there in his eyes when she climbs down the stairs to the dock. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; she asks.<br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; he answers, as he straightens his hat and tries to smile.<br>As they hug, she notices his hands are ice-cold and the back of his shirt is damp.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re covered in sweat.&#x201d;<br>Bj�rn avoids her eyes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been stressful getting ready to go.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bring my bag?&#x201d;<br>He nods and gestures toward the cabin. The boat rocks gently under her feet and the air smells of lacquered wood and sun-warmed plastic.<br>&#x201c;Hello? Anybody home?&#x201d; she asks, tapping his head.<br>His clear blue eyes are childlike and his straw-colored hair sticks out in tight dreadlocks from under the hat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here,&#x201d; he says. But he looks away.<br>&#x201c;What are you thinking about? Where&#x2019;s your mind gone to?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just that we&#x2019;re finally heading off together,&#x201d; he answers as he wraps his arms around her waist. &#x201c;And that we&#x2019;ll be having sex out in nature.&#x201d;<br>He buries his lips in her hair.<br>&#x201c;So that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re dreaming of,&#x201d; she whispers.<br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>She laughs at his honesty.<br>&#x201c;Most people&nbsp;... women, I mean, think that sex outdoors is a bit overrated,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Lying on the ground among ants and stones and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No. No. It&#x2019;s just like swimming naked,&#x201d; he insists.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to convince me,&#x201d; she teases.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do that, all right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How?&#x201d; She&#x2019;s laughing as the phone rings in her cloth bag.<br>Bj�rn stiffens when he hears the signal.

Some let it swallow them. I guess there&#x2019;s about a thousand degrees in between those extremes. Maybe a million. Maybe a million million. Who the fuck knows? Not me. I don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m just about able to put one foot before the other, to breathe again. But not always, not even most of the time. Annie, my wife, I mean, my ex-wife, she let it swallow her whole and when it spit her back up, she was someone else, something else: a hornet from a butterfly. If I was on the outside looking in and not the central target of her fury and sting, I might understand it. I might forgive it. I tell myself I would. But I&#x2019;d have to forgive myself first. I might as well wish for Jesus to reveal himself in my side view mirror or for John Jr. to come back to us. At the moment, my wishes were less ambitious ones. I wished for the 11:38 to Ronkonkoma to be on time. I should have wished for it to be early.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I checked the dashboard clock as I pulled into the hotel courtesy van parking spot out in front of the Dunkin Donuts shop at the station. <i>11:30,</i> <i>eight</i> <i>minutes</i> <i>to</i> <i>spare</i>. But spare time was empty time and I had come to dread it because empty was pretty much all I was anymore. Two years steeped in emptiness and I still didn&#x2019;t know how to fill it up. My shrink, Dr. Rosen, says not to try, that I should let myself fully experience the void. That if I don&#x2019;t give myself permission to feel the depth of the abyss, the slipperiness of its walls, I&#x2019;ll never climb out. The thing is, you have to want to climb out, don&#x2019;t you? Even a spare minute was chance enough to relive the last two years. Took forever to live it. Takes only seconds to live it again. I had tried filling in the fissures, cracks, and cavities with wondering, wondering about the trick of time. That got me about as far as wishing. Nowhere.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stepped out of the van into the chill night. My breath turned to heaving clouds of smoke as cold as God&#x2019;s love. <i>Hail</i> <i>Mary</i>, <i>full</i> <i>of</i> <i>shit</i>, <i>the Lord</i> <i>is</i> <i>with</i> <i>thee</i>, <i>not</i> <i>me</i>. I didn&#x2019;t really want coffee. No man who lives for sleep as I do wants coffee. But I had to sustain my waking trance until six AM. Then I could turn the van keys over to Fredo and fall into my cool sheet and quilt-covered solace. When I was on the job, it was different. Everything was different. I liked the world then and the people in it. Liked the buzz of caffeine. Yeah, that was me once, the cop in a donut shop, reinforcing stereotypes. Now I was just occupying my mind, doing something, anything not to sit in the van marking time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aziza, the mocha-skinned Pakistani girl behind the counter, nodded at me. Smiled a gap-toothed smile. She no longer asked what I wanted. <i>Small coffee. Half and Half. Two Sweet&#x2019;n Lows.</i> She made it up for me. Put it on the counter. She no longer gave me the change when I paid.<i> </i>She dropped the change in the paper tip cup with the other careless pennies, quarters, dimes, and nickels. I liked Aziza because she expected nothing of me beyond our routine. We danced our nightly dance and then went back to being strangers. She didn&#x2019;t expect me to put the pain behind me or to bravely get on with my life.</p><p>Khalid, the night manager, a fleshy man with shark eyes and a suspicious face, stared at me as he always did. It was as if he could smell the taint on me. He didn&#x2019;t like me in the shop. Thought I might sully the place with my taint or maybe that wasn&#x2019;t it at all.</p><p>I got back to the van as the 11:38 pulled into Ronkonkoma. In the eight minutes that had passed, the usual crowd had descended upon the station. Parents in double-parked SUVs, waiting to pick up their kids. Bored-looking husbands unhappy at being dragged off their sofas into the cold night because their wives felt like doing Broadway with the girls. Cabbies outside their cars, their flannel-shirted bellies flopping over their beltlines, smoking cigarettes, talking shit to each other. I placed the coffee inside the van and took out my Paragon Hotel placard on which the words Westex Technical were written in black marker.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I was scheduled to pick up a party of three from Westex and bring them back to the Paragon.&nbsp; The Paragon Hotel of Bohemia, New York was paragon of nothing so much as proximity, proximity to Long Island MacArthur Airport. And MacArthur Airport, an airport of three airlines, was nothing so much as an unfulfilled promise, the little airport that couldn&#x2019;t. The Paragon was a way station, a place to pass through on the way to or from the airport. There was the occasional foreign tourist who&#x2019;d fixated on the room rate instead of the distance to New York City or had neglected to convert kilometers into miles.</p><p>The three Westex guys were what I expected, what most of my passengers were: tired, hungry, distracted. When I got back into the van after loading their bags into the rear, all of them were busy with their phones or tablets. They kind of grunted to themselves and one another. I was glad of that, happy to be ignored. I had trouble with the chatty ones, the ones who wanted to be your pal. When I was on the job I understood nervous chatter because the uniform made people nervous. I also had empathy for the compulsively polite. Not anymore. Who in their heart of hearts really wanted to be the van driver&#x2019;s buddy? It was all so much bullshit, a way to pass time from point to point. I was in on the lie of passing time, so I never spoke first. Never asked where anyone was from. Never asked if they had enjoyed the city. Never asked what they did for a living, or about their families. Never asked where they were headed. I knew where they were headed. We were all headed there, eventually.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I put the van in drive, looked in my side view for oncoming cars or the second coming. And not seeing either, I pulled the wheel hard left and made a sweeping U-turn west onto Railroad Avenue. As we went I sipped at my unwanted coffee, thinking of my dead son.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two</p><p>(Tuesday Morning)</p><p>The phone bleating on the nightstand woke me from a dreamless sleep, but John Jr. was my first waking thought just as he had been my last conscious thought before I closed my eyes. It was as reflexive to me as blinking. After two years grieving him, missing him, tearing my guts out over his death, he never really left me. At least he was no longer every thought in between my first and last. There had been periods during that first year when I felt I would choke on his constant presence. When I would have given almost anything for a few minutes of simple forgetfulness. It got so oppressive that I began hating the son I had loved more than myself and then hated myself for hating him.&nbsp; <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The TV was still on but tuned to SportsCenter, so it could have been any time of the day or night. I looked out the southeast facing window of my room and saw the sun was relatively low in the sky. I felt the weariness still deep in my bones and knew I hadn&#x2019;t been asleep very long.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached for the phone.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah, what?&#x201d;</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I dozed off with the phone still in my hand. This time when it rang, I managed to press the talk button.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gus, there&#x2019;s a gentleman down here asking to see you.&#x201d; It was Felix at the front desk, his Filipino lilt less prominent when he was speaking in front of a guest.</p><p>&#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; I asked even as I stretched to see the clock radio.<br>&#x201c;Nine seventeen.&#x201d;</p><p>I yawned. &#x201c;This gentleman have a name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t give me his name, but he says you have dealt with him in the past.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That really narrows it down. What&#x2019;s he look like?&#x201d;</p><p>Felix cleared his throat and, without a hint of guile, whispered. &#x201c;Trouble.&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed, felt the smile on my face. It didn&#x2019;t used to feel so foreign. &#x201c;Tell him I&#x2019;m sleeping.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think I have attempted that, Gus? He said he will wait down here all day if that is</p><p>what it will take.&#x201d; Then Felix was whispering again. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a rough looking man with tattoos and he makes me nervous.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;All right. Tell him to go wait for me in the coffee shop and I&#x2019;ll be along.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;When?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;When I get there.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Thank you, Gus.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For my part, I was in no rush to get downstairs, but I liked Felix. He didn&#x2019;t have much of a heart for confrontation. On the other hand, I had spent most of my adult life collecting scar tissue from it. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;&nbsp; what cops did.</p><p>I brushed my teeth, finger combed my grief-gray hair&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what my sister called it&#x2014;and pulled on my Costco wardrobe: Kirkland jeans, black Tommy Hilfiger sweater, Kirkland athletic socks, and running shoes. My Glock, and ammo were the only pieces of my outfit that I hadn&#x2019;t bought at Costco. Even the black leather jacket I wore had come from there.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a five step stroll to the elevator from my room. The room was part of my deal with the Bonackers, the family that owned and managed the Paragon. I drove the van from six to six three or four nights a week and occasionally acted as house detective. Although the hotel was half-empty most of the time, the Full Flaps Lounge did big happy hour business because of its proximity to a large industrial park and office buildings. And when it was turned into a 70s and 80s throwback disco on Friday and Saturday evenings, things sometimes got a little hairy. Middle-aged men flexing their weekend beer muscles for drunk divorcees could get ugly, and often did. The Bonackers liked knowing that when I called the cops, they came, and fast.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lobby of the Paragon was actually a pretty grand sight if you didn&#x2019;t look too closely, and if your taste ran to despair. Completed in the mid-80s, the hotel had gone through several incarnations. The last time any serious work had been done on the place was prior to the 2008 financial collapse. It took more body blows after JetBlue declined to set up shop at MacArthur and Southwest began shifting flights to LaGuardia. The Paragon had already changed hands four or five times when the Bonackers bought it. The rooms were cheap, clean, and available. If that wasn&#x2019;t enough for you, you were shit out of luck.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded at Felix as I came off the elevator. He pointed his short little arm at the hotel coffee shop, poking the air with his finger. &#x201c;Big man, Gus. Very big.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I hope you take this the right way, Felix, but&#x2014;&#x201c;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you talk about my height again. I am the same size as Manny Pacquiao.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took a boxer&#x2019;s stance and threw a shadow jab. &#x201c;Too bad you don&#x2019;t punch like him.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;There is going to be trouble, do you think?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;re gonna find out.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked into the Runway coffee shop, the walls of which were covered in murals of great moments in aviation history connected to Long Island. Lindbergh taking off from Roosevelt Field for his flight to Le Bourget. The Grumman-built moon lander touching down in the Sea of Tranquility. The first A-10 rolling off the Fairchild Republic production line. A swept-wing Grumman F-14 swooping low over an airshow crowd at Jones Beach. For the second time in twenty minutes I laughed. I laughed because there would be no more such great moments. Roosevelt Field was now an enormous shopping mall. Fairchild Republic was gone and Grumman, once the largest employer on Long Island, had been&nbsp;dismembered and swallowed up, existing now only as a feeble outpost in a sea of abandonment. I knew a little something about that.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The coffee shop was nearly empty but for the ghostly scent of fried bacon and dark grace notes of burnt black coffee. Along with the smells of breakfast, the big man was the only other thing in the place. He sat at a booth, a cup of coffee before him on the wingtip-shaped table. I didn&#x2019;t approach him. He looked like somebody I knew, but I couldn&#x2019;t quite place him. When I was on the job I&#x2019;d had a steel trap memory, but the last two years had taken their toll. Not much was crisp or clear to me any longer.&nbsp; Vague familiarity was my default setting. Even the pain of John Jr.&#x2019;s loss had transformed itself from the excruciating burn of a puncture wound to the dull ache of a dying tooth. There was also something in the big man&#x2019;s expression that reminded me of my own reflection. A distance in his moist brown eyes, a disconnection from the moment. It&#x2019;s hard to explain, but it was there as sure as the cup in front of him.</p><p>I was frozen in place, pinned by the resonance in the big man&#x2019;s expression. That was when somebody in the kitchen dumped a load of silverware onto the sorting tray. The crash and jangle of the metal utensils broke the silence. The big man&#x2019;s eyes refocused. He turned to look up at me, a mournful smile on his crooked mouth. Yeah, I knew him: Thomas Delcamino, Tommy D. Everybody who had worked in the Second Precinct knew Tommy D. Most of us had arrested him. Many of us, more than once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Rhyme Schemer: (Book for Middle School Kids, Middle Grade Novel, In Verse Novel for Boys)</h2><p>Kevin has a bad attitude. He's the one who laughs when you trip and fall. In fact, he may have been the one who tripped you in the first place. He has a real knack for rubbing people the wrong way&#x2014;and he's even figured out a secret way to do it with poems. But what happens when the tables are turned and he is the one getting picked on? <em>Rhyme Schemer</em> is a touching and hilarious middle-grade novel in verse about one seventh grader's journey from bully-er to bully-ee, as he learns about friendship, family, and the influence that words can have on people's lives.</p><p>K.

An American journalist of Chinese descent raising a young family in Shanghai, Lenora Chu noticed how well-behaved Chinese children were compared to her boisterous toddler. How did the Chinese create their academic super-achievers? Would their little boy benefit from Chinese school? </p><p>Chu and her husband decided to enroll three-year-old Rainer in China&#x2019;s state-run public school system. The results were positive&#x2014;her son quickly settled down, became fluent in Mandarin, and enjoyed his friends&#x2014;but she also began to notice troubling new behaviors. Wondering what was happening behind closed classroom doors, she embarked on an exploratory journey, interviewing Chinese parents, teachers and education professors, and following students at all stages of their education. </p><p>What she discovered is a military-like education system driven by high-stakes testing, with teachers posting rankings in public, using bribes to reward students who comply, and shaming to isolate those who do not. At the same time, she uncovered a years-long desire by government to alleviate its students&#x2019; crushing academic burden and make education friendlier for all. The more she learns, the more she wonders: Are Chinese children&#x2014;and her son&#x2014;paying too high a price for their obedience and the promise of future academic prowess? Is there a way to appropriate the excellence of the system but dispense with the bad? What, if anything, could Westerners learn from China&#x2019;s education journey? </p><p>Chu&#x2019;s eye-opening investigation challenges our assumptions and asks us to consider the true value and purpose of education.</p><p></p></p><p><p>When American journalist Lenora Chu moved to Shanghai with her little boy, Rainey, just down the street from <em>the</em> state-run school&#x2014;the best, as far as elite Chinese were concerned&#x2014;she faced an important decision: Should she entrust her rambunctious young son to the Chinese public schools?</p><p>It seemed like a good idea at the time, and so began Rainey&#x2019;s immersion in one of the most radical school systems on the planet. Almost immediately, the three-year-old began to develop surprising powers of concentration and became proficient in early math. Yet Chu also noticed disturbing new behaviors: Whereas he used to scribble and explore, Rainey was now obsessed with staying inside the lines. He became fearful of authority figures. &#x201c;If you want me to do it, I&#x2019;ll do it,&#x201d; he told a stranger who had asked whether he liked to sing.</p><p>Driven by parental concern, Chu embarked on an investigative mission: What price do the Chinese pay to produce their &#x201c;smart&#x201d; kids, and what lessons might Western parents and educators learn from this system?&nbsp;</p><p>In her search for answers, Chu followed Chinese students, teachers, and experts, pulling back the curtain on a military-style education system in which even the youngest kids submit to high-stakes tests and parents are crippled by the pressure to compete. Yet as Chu delved deeper, she discovered surprising upsides, such as the benefits of memorization, competition as a motivator, and the Chinese cultural belief in hard work over innate talent.</p><p>Lively and intimate, beautifully written and reported, <em>Little Soldiers</em> asks us to reconsider the true value and purpose of education, as China and the West compete for the political and economic dominance of a new generation.</p><p>Lenora Chu is a Chinese American writer whose work explores the intersection of culture, policy, and behavior.

He was a politician's politician, always operating behind the scenes, masterfully pulling the levers of the legislative process in a unique and colorful fashion.<br>Legacy to Power tells Russell Long's story and the larger story to which it belongs - the fascinating tale of the Longs of Louisiana, one of America's greatest political dynasties. For almost six decades, the Long family dominated Louisiana politics: Russell's legendary father, populist senator Huey Long, his flamboyant Uncle Earl, a three-term Louisiana governor, and his mother, who served in the Senate after Huey's death, were among the many Longs in public office. When Huey Long died from an assassin's bullet in 1935, Russell, aged sixteen, became heir to his father's powerful political legacy. His entry into politics in 1948 was kindled by an obsession to rehabilitate his father's tarnished reputation. Elected to the Senate the day before his thirtieth birthday, he embraced some of Huey's populist politics but soon acquired his own distinctive style. Where Huey had been fiery and impatient, Russell was quiet, respectful, and tolerant, wielding his power with a velvet glove.<br>This is also the story of how the Washington political game evolved after World War II and how Russell Long mastered the game by constantly outwitting his more sophisticated legislative foes. Long - who served with eight presidents from Truman to Reagan - played a role in most foreign policy issues of his time, including the perennial debate over foreign aid, the Korean conflict, and the divisive Vietnam War. During his chairmanship of the Finance Committee, Long was at the center of most of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs of the 1960s and 70s. He became what his father abhorred - the ultimate Washington insider - and his political technique was so refined that Newsweek once said Russell Long could "outtalk, outfoot, and outfox just about any man in the Senate." The last of the Senate's great southern barons, he was praised from all quarters, Republicans and Democrats alike, when he retired in 1987.<br>This fast-paced and sharply written biography full of political intrigue, personal insight, and colorful anecdotes of Washington life - from the backroom politics that brought a football team to New Orleans to the spirited filibusters and wily compromises that shaped the nation's civil rights laws. Sometimes critical in its assessment of Long, Legacy to Power is a celebration of a great and tragic dynasty that survived an assassination and rose to new heights of power, only to find its members often pitted against each other. Despite their differences in style and method, Russell Long never wavered in his abiding affection for his family's powerful legacy and was dedicated always to the compassionate ideas that spawned this extraordinary political dynasty.</p><p>Robert Mann is the author of four books, three of them about the United States Senate: A Grand Delusion: America&#39;s Descent into Vietnam; The Walls of Jericho: Lyndon Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, Richard Russell, and the Struggle for Civil Rights; Legacy To Power: Senator Russell Long of Louisiana; and, The Complete Idiot&#39;s Guide to the Cold War.Long's decision not to seek reelection to the Senate from Louisiana in 1986 brought an end to almost four decades of service in that body. The son of former Louisiana governor and senator Huey Long, and the nephew of another former governor, Earl Long, Russell lacks the flamboyant, populist style of his father and uncle. But he was one of the masters of the rules and folkways of the Senate--using his position as chair of the Finance Committee and his coalition-building skills to shape numerous major pieces of legislation. Biographer Mann, a former press secretary of Long, examines Long's career from a favorable but not entirely uncritical perspective. The book will be a useful addition to collections emphasizing modern American politics.

How could you run, how could you fight, when doing so would hurt that beloved one? If your life was all you had to give, how could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved?<br><br></em></strong>To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife have led her to the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.<br><br>Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating, and unfathomable, consequences. Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life--first discovered in <i>Twilight</i>, then scattered and torn in <i>New Moon</i> and <i>Eclipse</i>--seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?<br><br>The astonishing, breathlessly anticipated conclusion to the Twilight Saga, <i>Breaking Dawn </i>illuminates the secrets and mysteries of this spellbinding romantic epic that has entranced millions.</p><p>Great love stories thrive on sacrifice. Throughout The Twilight Saga (<em>Twilight</em>, <em>New Moon</em>, and <em>Eclipse</em>), Stephenie Meyer has emulated great love stories--<em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, <em>Wuthering Heights</em>--with the fated, yet perpetually doomed love of Bella (the human girl) and Edward (the vampire who feeds on animals instead of humans). In <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, the fourth and final installment in the series, Bella&#x2019;s story plays out in some unexpected ways. The ongoing conflicts that made this series so compelling--a human girl in love with a vampire, a werewolf in love with a human girl, the generations-long feud between werewolves and vampires--resolve pretty quickly, apparently so that Meyer could focus on Bella&#x2019;s latest opportunity for self-sacrifice: giving her life for someone she loves even more than Edward. How close she comes to actually making that sacrifice is questionable, which is a big shift from the earlier books. Even though you knew Bella would make it through somehow, the threats to her life, and to her relationship with Edward, had previously always felt real. It&#x2019;s as if Meyer was afraid of hurting her characters too much, which is unfortunate, because the pain Bella suffered at losing Edward in <em>New Moon</em>, and the pain Jacob suffered at losing Bella again and again, are the fire and the heart that drive the whole series. Diehard fans will stick with Bella, Edward, and Jacob for as many twists and turns as possible, but after most of the characters get what they want with little sacrifice, some readers may have a harder time caring what happens next.

The All-American Cleaver family, writes the series' star, provided "innocence, optimism, respectability, and adventure. The pleasures were simple and the values were constant." Through episodic "morality plays," the show "presented a child's view of the world." That child, of course, was "the Beaver," played by 10-year-old Mathers, and the show provided the closest thing the baby-boom generation had to cultural mythology. The only surprise in Mathers's autobiography may be the impressive credits with which he came to the role in 1957, having already worked with such luminaries as Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Durante, Ray Bolger, Alfred Hitchcock, Shirley MacLaine and John Forsythe. Unfortunately, this Hollywood memoir reads as if it were penned by the Beav himself, rather than by a 50-year-old man with two marriages and a philosophy degree from UC-Berkeley behind him. Mathers delivers a poorly written recitation of data rather than an in-depth examination of a life or career, and the voices of other actors from the show contribute little additional scope. This collection of trivia will appeal only to die-hard fans and avid collectors of Beaver memorabilia. For others, it may simply provide further evidence of the banality of American pop culture.

I felt them all take a deep breath as I made my way to the �aisle.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s funeral service was held on October 23, 2003, at the biggest church in Calgary, yet it overflowed with an eclectic throng of thousands who came to pay their respects to the legendary Stu Hart, �old-�time pro wrestling promoter �extraordinaire.<br><br>I moved slowly, a silent prayer resounding in my head, &#x201c;Please, God, help me make it through.&#x201d; I am an experienced public speaker, but my confidence had been shattered by a major �stroke.<br><br>It hadn&#x2019;t been that long since I&#x2019;d been trapped in a wheelchair, paralyzed on the left side, unsure whether I&#x2019;d ever walk again. Since then I&#x2019;d been having emotional meltdowns triggered by the most unlikely things; this is common among stroke victims. I didn&#x2019;t know how I was going to deliver a eulogy worthy of my father and not break down. It was also hard for me to walk tall when I felt so many eyes measuring the difference between what I was �now&#x2013;�my body stiff, the chiselled edges softened&#x2013;�to what I&#x2019;d been.<br><br>But when I walked past the pew where my brothers and sisters �sat&#x2013;�my limp more noticeable than I wanted&#x2013;�I sensed, perhaps for the first time in our lives, that they were all behind me, even those with whom I&#x2019;d had differences. <i>Do it for Dad, Bret. Do it for all of us. Do us proud.</i> There&#x2019;d been twelve Hart kids, and now there were ten. Our beloved mother, Helen, had died just two years earlier. We&#x2019;d all been through so much, travelled such a long, long road.<br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t just the end of my father&#x2019;s life, this was something deeper, and I think we all felt it. So many times over so many years I truly thought this godforsaken business was dead to me, but this was the day pro wrestling died for me&#x2013;�for good.<br><br>In the front pew sat Vince McMahon, billionaire promoter of the WWE (once the WWF), who&#x2019;d made a failed attempt to steal my dignity, my career and my reputation. Beside him sat Carlo DeMarco, my old friend turned loyal McMahon lieutenant. They were doing their best to look dignified, but I knew&#x2013;�and they knew I knew&#x2013;�that McMahon&#x2019;s presence at Stu Hart&#x2019;s funeral was more about image than anything else. It only made me more determined to climb the steps with my head held high. <i>You don&#x2019;t matter to me any more, Vince. I survived you, and everything else too.</i> I had thought it was wrestling&#x2019;s darkest hour when I&#x2019;d had my heart cut out in the middle of the ring by that son of a bitch. Then the Grim Reaper of wrestling took my youngest brother, Owen, and that was the blackest day.<br><br>Keep walking, I told myself, for Davey, Pillman, Curt, Rick, Liz . . . so many of us are gone, so young, and directly on account of the wrestling life. Hell, even Hawk. People told me he had wept like a baby when he heard Stu had died of pneumonia at eighty�three . . . and then Hawk died that very night. One more for the list. And surely not the last.<br><br>I reached into my breast pocket and took out my notes, carefully unfolding them on the slippery, polished surface of the oak podium. I surveyed the crowd, my gaze stopping at the young apprentices, Chris Benoit, Edge and Storm, who looked back at me with respectful anticipation. Next I glanced at a company of stalwart ring veterans&#x2013;The Cuban, Leo, Hito, even Bad �News&#x2013;�all more ruminative and melancholy than I&#x2019;d ever seen them. I read it in their faces, the unspoken truth that burying a man like Stu Hart was truly the end of what we had lived �for&#x2013;�and too many had died for.<br><br>And then the sight of old Killer Kowalski, in his good suit, transported me back four decades, to before Owen was even born.<br><br>I am a survivor with a story to tell. There&#x2019;s never been an accurate account of the history of pro wrestling. All the public knows is what is packaged and sold to them by the industry. Since I&#x2019;m no longer in the business, I&#x2019;m in a decent position to tell the truth, without fear of recrimination. With this book, which is based on the audio diary I kept through all my years in wrestling, starting in my early twenties, I want to put you in my shoes so you can experience what pro wrestling was like in my era, through my eyes. It&#x2019;s not my intention to take needless jabs at those who made the journey with me, but I&#x2019;ll pull no punches either. Not here.<br><br>Wrestling was never my dream, and all too often it was my nightmare. Yet ingrained in me from birth was the instinct to defend it like a religion. For as long as I can remember, my world has been filled with liars and bullshitters, losers and con men. But I&#x2019;ve also seen the good side of pro wrestling. To me there is something beautiful about a brotherhood of big, tough men who only pretend to hurt one another for a living instead of actually doing it. I came to appreciate that there is an art to it. In contrast to my father, who loved to proudly tell people who the real tough guys, or shooters, of his generation were, I can just as proudly tell you who the great workers, or pretenders, of my generation were. Unlike so many wrestlers with their various made�up names and adopted personae, I was authentic, born Bret Hart into a wrestling world I couldn&#x2019;t escape. I can&#x2019;t say life&#x2019;s been easy, but I can say it&#x2019;s been interesting.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve always thought of myself as a quiet, easygoing kind of guy, and I believe I was well respected by most of my peers. Some have labelled me as arrogant, and others say I lacked charisma. Admittedly, I wasn&#x2019;t the best talker or mic man in the business, but I more than made up for it with my technical proficiency in the ring. I don&#x2019;t think anyone can rightly dispute that I was a wrestler who put the art first and gave everything I had to the business&#x2013;�and to the fans.<br><br>I&#x2019;ve always been grateful to have been a world champion who actually did travel the world. People from all walks of life, from New York to Nuremberg, from Calgary to Kyoto, have told me that I inspired them in some way and that I represented everything that was decent about pro wrestling, the way it used to be, when there was still honour in it. It seems like all the world loves an honest battler.<br><br>I worked hard to bring out the best in my opponents. I gratefully acknowledge the hundreds of wrestlers I worked with in thousands of matches over twenty�three years, and am proud that I never injured another wrestler to the point that he couldn&#x2019;t work the next day. Regrettably, I can&#x2019;t say the same about some of those who worked with me. I took it as a challenge to have a good match with anybody. I respected both the green�horn jobbers, whose role it was to lose or put me over, and the old-timers, the big tough men of wrestling who allowed me the honour of standing over them with my hand raised. I refused to lose to a fellow wrestler only once in my career, and that was because he refused to do the same for me and others.<br><br>The public record is filled with false impressions of me from those who think they know me. Sadly, that includes some members of my own family. My youth wasn&#x2019;t as loving and sweet as the fable that&#x2019;s been perpetuated in wrestling lore. I&#x2019;ve been hurt and betrayed by some of my brothers and sisters, yet I don&#x2019;t feel I ever let them down. Some of them sometimes behave as though they begrudge what I&#x2019;ve achieved, even though I&#x2019;ve paid my dues in ways they can&#x2019;t even imagine. The truth is, my family knows very little about me.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t easy growing up the eighth of twelve kids, with seven brothers and four sisters. As a child I was drawn to my sweet mother and intimidated by my gruff father. Stu had a temper so fierce that some would consider his corporal punishment child abuse. Too many times I limped around bruised and battered, my eyeballs red and ruptured because of his discipline. On more than a few occasions I thought I was going to die before he was done with me. Often, as I was on the verge of blacking out from some choke hold of Stu&#x2019;s, he&#x2019;d huff, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve breathed your last breath.&#x201d;<br><br>My father was two different people. At an early age I began to call one of them Stu, and I was terrified of him. Dad was the father I loved. When I was little I used to think Stu overlooked the bad behaviour of his favourite kids and ignored the goodness in the kids who didn&#x2019;t matter as much to him. Looking back I can see that he was hardest on the ones he thought had the most potential. He instilled in me a tenacious drive to succeed by implanting in me his own strong fear of failure. For most of my youth, he teetered on the brink of bankruptcy while I feared becoming the first Hart kid to fail a grade in school. My empathy with his fear connected us.<br><br>Like my father, I developed at least a couple of alter egos. At home I kept to myself and generally did whatever my older brothers told me to do; it was just easier that way. At my father&#x2019;s wrestling shows every Friday night, I played Joe Cool, popular with the girls and on top of the world&#x2013;�all part of the show. At school I was shy, but the fights were real. All the Hart kids were bullied for wearing hand-me-downs, and I was always scrapping to defend the family honour. The wrestling fans on Friday nights had no idea that I often attended school wearing shorts in the winter because that&#x2019;s all I had, or that I got my first pair of new runners when I was fourteen.<br><br>Later on in life I was one guy on the road, another at home and yet another in the ring.

Brought to Bucharest on assignment for NPR and ABC, Codrescu chronicles his journey and the events precipitating it, as well as his first jubilant reactions while standing in bloodstained, ice- covered University Square on New Year's Day 1990. Sobered by subsequent experiences on the streets and in the corridors of power, he records encounters with people from all walks of life living their first winter of freedom in 45 years in a city ravaged by recent fighting and decades of inadequate food and supplies. A journey to his birthplace in Transylvania summons a surge of memories, enhanced when he renews contact with high-school friends, and he vows to return for their reunion in the summer. When he does, in the wake of a renewed struggle against the National Salvation Front with its Communist leadership, and a dubious national election, he finds that the heady spirit of a few months before has already vanished, replaced by a reactionary mood and assertions that the revolution had been betrayed from the start. A final blow occurs at the reunion, as he sees that his school buddies profited immensely under tyranny, and the aftermath has fostered in them a vigorous nationalism and racism not seen publicly since the Nazi days. Intensely personal and keenly perceptive: a poignant study of a troubled homecoming, and a lively resource for anyone who would understand Romania today. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Poet and National Public Radio commentator Codrescu ( Belligerence ) was born in Romania, left as a teenager and returned to observe the shocks and joys of revolution from December 1989 to January 1991. This report of his homecoming, jubilation and disenchantment makes an excellent companion volume to Codrescu's early memoir, The Life and Times of an Involuntary Genius . The first book was a lyric portrait of the artist as a raffish would-be poet in rural Transylvania; the one in hand is an equally sly but more worldly meditation on politics and personal history. The author opens on a note of sobriety, recounting the apparent end of despotism. The remainder of the book bears a more individual imprint, as Codrescu revisits scenes from his past, tries to look up old friends and offers thoughts on "cultural genocide." His outlook is summed up with the words, "I have never been able to abide either authority or bureaucrats. That is why I'm a poet." And thus, he finds enough still to rail against in Romania, questioning the veracity of the revolution itself as a series of "staged media events" possibly brought about by an elite conspiracy. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Women&#39;s Work: Textile Art from the Bauhaus</h2><p>Resurrecting the work of gifted craftswomen, too long denied their place as pioneers in their field, Women's Work: Textile Art from the Bauhaus unearths a missing chapter in the story of the most important institution in the history of modern design.<br>The Bauhaus defined modern design in the twentieth century. As the preeminent design phenomenon of the era, almost every aspect of it has been minutely examined. Yet the Weaving Workshop, the longest standing and most successful of all Bauhaus workshops, has been neglected for one simple reason: when the first wave of brilliantly talented women arrived at the school, they soon discovered that Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius could not sustain his ringing declaration of equality between "the beautiful and the strong gender." Textiles, in the hierarchy of art and design, were to be "women's work."<br>Their results, however, were remarkable, both in the early days of artistic expression in Weimar and in later developments in the textile industry. The craftswomen responded to the demands of advanced technology with fabrics that incorporated new or unusual materials such as Cellophane, leather and early synthetics, which had acoustic and light-reflecting properties. They produced multi-layered fabrics, cloths with double and triple weaves, and later made extensive use of the jacquard loom. The result was a rebirth of hand-weaving and new professionalism in designing textiles for mass production.<br>In this model study, superlatively documented with rare or little-seen photographs of the textiles and their makers, Sigrid Wortmann Weltge captures the heady atmosphere of creative excitement at the Bauhaus. Original archival research and interviews, both with survivors and their students and with leading contemporary designers, detail the workshop's history and its enduring legacy. When the Nazis closed the institution in 1933, its members dispersed to Switzerland, Holland, England, France, Russia, Mexico, and throughout the United States; their ideals and influence live on in marvelous fabrics still being produced today.</p><p>Sigrid Wortmann Weltge is an Associate Professor in Art History at the Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science.This book is neither a catalogue raisonne, nor a compilation of weave data. Instead, it pays tribute to members of the Bauhaus whose names are not known to a larger public. Female students, who were among the first wave of women after WWI to aspire to membership of the professional design community, arrived at the school with an astonishing diversity of talents, convinced that this avant garde institution would accept them as equals. Many already had extensive training in the arts. High-spirited and anti-bourgeois, they participated on many levels in the life of the Bauhaus.</p><h2>The Last of the Just (Library of the Holocaust)</h2><p>According to Jewish tradition, 36 &#34;just men&#34; are born in every generation to take the burden of the world&#39;s suffering upon themselves.

To learn more about Cristina, visit her website: http://www.cristinakessler.comAges 5-8. When a Sudanese village installs a new water pump, young Fatima is the first to push the handle. In the past, the villagers coped with the long, dry seasons by storing water in the trunks of the ancient baobab trees. But with the new pump, nobody prepares their trees except Fatima's grandmother, who is skeptical about disregarding the "old ways." With Fatima's help, she fills her tree, and when the pump breaks during a drought, the villagers flock to the baobab, as grandmother says, "Maybe it's wise to mix old with new." Despite the heavy message, this is a lyrically told story with cultural particulars woven gracefully into the text. With creative perspectives and spare compositions, Krudop's oil illustrations ably extend the story's strong sense of character and place, showing the respect between Fatima and her grandmother and for the tree set against the stark landscape. Another intriguing African story from a longtime resident of the continent. Included are a helpful author's note and a glossary of the few Arabic words used in text. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Other figures treated in depth are Chaucer, Milton, Donne, Wordsworth, Dickens, Eliot, and Auden. An examination of such modern authors as Philip Larkin, Seamus Heaney, and Edward Bond brings the story up to date. The book is, throughout, far more than a mere outline of periods and schools of writing. Capturing the pleasure and exhilaration of literature, it moves beyond facts and events to present the broad sweep of ideas and the main concerns of British writers across some 1,200 years. The nine contributors are all acknowledged experts in the particular areas, and they bring to their sections not just deep knowledge but genuine zest and affection for their subjects.<br> The illustrations--32 in color and more than 200 in black and white--reflect the content and concerns of the chapters. They range from manuscript and book illustrations to works of art and architecture, portraits, social scenes, landscapes, and caricatures. Rather than simply decorating the text, they illuminate the ideas, preoccupations, and outlooks of the various periods treated. Also included in this handsome volume are suggestions for further reading, maps, and a table of important dates.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor:</em><br> Pat Rogers is Professor of English at Bristol University.

Conceived within a clandestine relationship between a black man and a married white woman, Spain was born (as Larry Michael Armstrong) in Mississippi during the mid-1950s. Spain's life story speaks to the destructive power of racial bias. Even if his mother's husband were willing to accept the boy�which he was not�a mixed-race child inevitably would come to harm in that place and time. </p><p>At six years old, already the target of name-calling children and threatening adults, he could not attend school with his older brother. Only decades later would he be told why the Armstrongs sent him to live with a black family in Los Angeles. As Johnny came of age, he thought of himself as having been rejected by his white family as well as by his black peers. His erratic, destructive behavior put him on a collision course with the penal system; he was only seventeen when convicted of murder and sent to Soledad. </p><p>Drawn into the black power movement and the Black Panther Party by a fellow inmate, the charismatic George Jackson, Spain became a dynamic force for uniting prisoners once divided by racial hatred. He committed himself to the cause of prisoners' rights, impressing inmates, prison officials, and politicians with his intelligence and passion. Nevertheless, among the San Quentin Six, only he was convicted of conspiracy after Jackson's failed escape attempt. </p><p>Lori Andrews, a professor of law, vividly portrays the dehumanizing conditions in the prisons, the pervasive abuses in the criminal justice system, and the case for overturning Spain's conspiracy conviction. Spain's personal transformation is the heart of the book, but Andrews frames it within an indictment of intolerance and injustice that gives this individual's story broad significance.</p></p><h2>Fitness: Theory &amp; Practice : The Comprehensive Resource for Fitness Instruction</h2><p>&#34;Comprehensive resource for fitness instruction.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>If My Product&#39;s So Great How Come I Can&#39;t Sell It</h2><p>Four Agreements for Marketers <p>100 Customers in 100 Days</p></p><p>If you are one of the trillion people trying to sell something you love and hearing NO get this book! -- <i>Joe Vitale, Internet Marketing Guru July 4, 2004</i></p><h2>The Digging Leviathan</h2><p>Born with a set of gills, webbed fingers, and flippers, Giles Peach, an ingenious, imaginative young man addicted to the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, becomes convinced that he is an exiled native of the center of the earth and sets out to return home</p><p>Winner of the World Fantasy Award and the Philip K.

The destination is the source of the Ganges, the holy and most famous of Indian rivers. It is a physical journey, involving train rides across the vast plains and passages on foot far into snow-covered valleys and mountains. It is also a spiritual journey, taking a man deep into the heart and soul of the ancient religious culture of India. <br><br>Stephen Alter, who was born in the Himalayan foothills, crosses many miles, and several millennia, to search for the source of Indian religion. Along the way, as he reaches one holy spot after another, meeting grounds for pilgrims, remote towns, and forgotten temples, he delves into the myths and traditions of an antique land. He explores the tales of heroic derring-do, evil and good, and recounts the great stories of death, warfare, passions, and sacred wisdom that animate the vibrant history and religious traditions of India. As every pilgrim learns, a spiritual search involves travel but ultimately returns to the inner self. Sacred Waters is a richly told narrative of a beautiful land and of a man's interior journey, and is for readers everywhere who seek to plumb their own spiritual sources.<br> <br></p><p>Garhwal, boasting the four sources of the Ganges River in northern India, must qualify as one of the most sacred stretches of land in the world, and novelist Stephen Alter transports us there in his travelogue <i>Sacred Waters</i>. Countless pilgrims make the same trip every year, but whereas they now travel by bus, Alter does it the old-fashioned way, trekking to each of the headwaters on foot. Since this is also Alter's birthplace and childhood stomping grounds, we couldn't ask for a better guide. He knows each species of plant, bird, and beast by name and tells the grand tales of Hindu mythology associated with the ancient terrain. Fluent in the local languages, he also makes us privy to his chats with pot-smoking sadhus, greedy Brahmins, simple nomads, and pilgrims that he meets along the way. Although Alter has the tendency to slip into the emotionless detachment of a journalist in his descriptions, there remains enough wonder at the power of the natural landscape and color in the fantastic myths to make <i>Sacred Waters</i> a trek worth taking. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Stephen Alter is writer-in-residence in the Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies at MIT, and was the director of the writing program at Cairo's American University. He is the author of four novels and a memoir, All the Way to Heaven, as well as the recently published Amritsar to Lahore. <br></p><h2>Roy Stuart: The Fourth Body</h2><p>From peek-a-boo panties to same-sex petting to more &#34;&#34;indiscreet&#34;&#34; activities, Stuart&#39;s titillating mises-en-scene challenge us to break loose from traditional moral codes.

He lives in Stonington, Connecticut.Montgomery<br><br>Throughout the early spring of 1861, the sleepy little city of Montgomery, Alabama, found itself caught up in a state of jubilant uproar and patriotic euphoria. Ever since February, when it was proclaimed provisional capital of the Confederate States of America, trainloads of strangers had been pouring into town from all across the South--patriots and adventurers, visionaries and opportunists--crowding the city's streets and monopolizing its facilities, eagerly clamoring to participate in the creation of a huge new nation the size of western Europe.<br><br>In April, the level of excitement in Montgomery ratcheted up to new heights when news of the bombardment of Fort Sumter came clattering over the telegraph from Charleston. Overnight, a new martial spirit gripped the city, and a heady sense of participating in the unfolding of great events was everywhere apparent. The fledgling Confederate government, suddenly faced with the need to put itself on a war footing, quickly ran out of office space and was forced to take rooms in the Exchange Hotel.<br><br>Despite the sense of urgency generated by the news of war, President Jefferson Davis maintained a serene equanimity. For months he and other Southern leaders had hoped that the secession of the Southern states might be managed peacefully, but now that war had come, he remained optimistic. He was convinced that the war would all be over in a matter of weeks. It could not last much longer than that. Neither side was prepared for a more extended conflict, and it was bound to sputter to an inconclusive end as soon as the hotheads in Washington came to understand the futility of trying to force the seceded states back into the Union against their will.<br><br>Besides, the Europeans would not allow a long war. Both Great Britain and France maintained huge textile industries, which were totally dependent on regular supplies of raw cotton from the South. If those supplies were stopped by the blockade that President Abraham Lincoln had just announced, thousands of European textile mills would have to close, millions of factory hands would be thrown out of work, and there would be riots in the streets of Manchester and Lyons. Davis was confident that before that could happen, the British and French navies would steam across the Atlantic, force open the blockade, and give Mr. Lincoln a choice: He could either sue for peace or find himself battling not just the South but the great powers of Europe as well.<br><br>Davis was convinced that the key to victory was cotton, and for months he had been encouraging cotton growers to hold their harvest off the market in order to increase pressure on Europe. The less raw cotton the mills had in inventory, the faster their governments would act to ensure the supply. It was just another precautionary step on his part to guarantee a short war.<br><br>Most of the members of Jefferson Davis's cabinet shared his optimism, but since there was no guarantee that the Yankees would behave in a reasonable manner, they continued to labor diligently to meet the Northern threat. It was always possible, after all, that the war might drag on for as long as a year.<br><br>During those first hectic weeks of the war, the cabinet officer under the most immediate pressure was probably Stephen R. Mallory, the newly appointed secretary of the navy. It was his responsibility to organize a response to the blockade the Yankees were already putting in place, and that was not going to be easy. The South had virtually nothing in the way of a navy with which to fight back. The entire Confederate fleet consisted of a sorry collection of four small revenue cutters, three leaky slavers, and a handful of smaller boats inherited from the seceded states, and there was no chance of improving the situation in the immediate future. It takes time and money to build proper warships, and Mallory had little of either.<br><br>With his round, open face and vaguely distracted appearance, the forty-nine-year-old Mallory bore a striking resemblance to Mr. Pickwick. The similarity was enhanced by his penchant for swallowtail coats and his fondness for good company and a liberally fortified punch bowl. But Mallory was no Dickensian innocent. Behind his genial manner lay a sharp and imaginative intellect. He was a highly skilled admiralty lawyer and a practiced politician. He was also the only member of the Confederate executive who had any real grasp of war at sea or understanding of the true power of navies.<br><br>Mallory was something of an outsider. Many of the politicians in Montgomery had opposed his nomination for secretary of the navy. Some distrusted him because he had originally cautioned against secession, while others were suspicious of him because he owned no slaves. It did not help that he was also a Roman Catholic, which made him something of a curiosity in a society that was predominantly Episcopalian and Presbyterian. In the end, he had been selected because Jefferson Davis felt he needed someone from Florida in his cabinet.<br><br>In the years before the war, Mallory had served in the United States Senate, where, as chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs, he made it his business to learn everything he could about the revolutionary developments in steam power, shell guns, and armor plate that were rapidly transforming the navies of the world. In time he would put that knowledge to good use. Under his leadership the Confederate Navy would establish an impressive record for innovation. But any plans he might have to create a modern fleet for the South still lay far in the future. His immediate problem was to find some way to deal with the Yankee blockade.<br><br>It was a formidable challenge. The proposed blockade was to be a colossal enterprise, an immense cordon of U.S. Navy warships that would eventually stretch 3,500 miles from Chesapeake Bay to the Mexican border at Matamoros. Mallory knew that the Yankees did not as yet have the ships to mount such a seaborne offensive, but he had no doubt they would build the necessary vessels soon enough, and when they did, it would be up to him to find a way to counter the threat. If he failed, the Federal fleet would eventually strangle the South, choking off access to the European military supplies the Confederacy needed to fight the war, as well as the outward flow of cotton bales required to pay for them.<br><br>Undoubtedly, had it been within his power, Mallory would have chosen to smash the blockade with a squadron of modern ironclad steamers, each one armed with powerful rifled guns, firing the new explosive shells. Such an invincible fleet could reduce the Yankees' wooden warships to kindling, and open the South's ports to the world.<br><br>But Mallory knew that the immediate prospect for such a force was little more than a pipe dream. The South, for all its fine harbors and broad rivers, had never developed a maritime infrastructure. It was an agricultural society, dependent almost entirely on slave labor, with neither the shipyards nor the skilled workforce needed to build the warships it now so desperately needed. Before Mallory could build them, he would have to create the necessary ironworks, foundries, and rolling mills and either import or train the shipwrights, mechanics, and engineers needed to operate them, all of which was going to take much time and energy.<br><br>Meanwhile, he needed some sort of stopgap measure that would at least make things difficult for the Yankees. Toward that end, he developed a secondary strategy, a simpler and cheaper scheme that he could put into operation much more quickly. He would build or buy a handful of inexpensive wooden ships, each one lightly armed with a few guns, and send them out to sea, not to wage war against the powerful blockading squadrons of the U.S. Navy but against a far larger and more vulnerable Yankee fleet--the huge armada of American commercial vessels that plied the trade routes of the world. These ships represented one of the North's most valuable economic assets. Unarmed Yankee merchant vessels would make easy targets for his commerce raiders, and Mallory calculated it would take only a few such cruisers to create so much havoc that the Union Navy would be forced to withdraw large numbers of its own vessels from the blockade in order to hunt down the gunships, thereby opening up the vital trade routes to Europe.<br><br>Mallory hoped to create the raiders simply by purchasing ordinary merchant ships and arming them. He had originally expected to find the ships he needed in Southern ports, but when he sent out inquiries, he quickly discovered there were almost no commercial vessels to be had in the Confederacy. His search turned up only one likely candidate, a Gulf Coast packet steamer named the Habana, which was laid up in New Orleans. Mallory sent one of his senior officers, Commander Raphael Semmes, to investigate, and Semmes had reported back by telegraph, expressing cautious optimism. With Mallory's approval he purchased the little steamer, which he rechristened the CSS Sumter, and had started the process of reinforcing and arming her. The Sumter would be a beginning, Mallory hoped, but neither he nor Semmes considered her anything more than a temporary expedient.<br><br>It was evident to Mallory that if he wanted cruisers, he was going to have to look outside the Confederacy. For various reasons he decided to try Great Britain. If he could not find what he wanted in England, there were any number of superior shipyards there, and he could always arrange to have his gunships built to order.<br><br>The trick was going to be finding the right man to send across the Atlantic. Obviously Mallory needed someone who knew his way around shipbuilding facilities and who understood naval construction, steam engines, and modern armament. But equally important, Mallory needed someone he could trust, and trust implicitly. Whomever he sent to England would be operating on his own, thousands of miles from any supervision, making important decisions involving hundreds of thousands of dollars of government money, and working in a rough-and-ready marketplace notorious for its under-th...</p><h2>Country Plumbing: Living With a Septic System</h2><p>You can keep your "country plumbing" working day after day, year after year.

In The Emperor of All Maladies, Siddhartha Mukherjee, doctor, researcher and award-winning science writer, examines cancer with a cellular biologist&#39;s precision, a historian&#39;s perspective, and a biographer&#39;s passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with - and perished from - for more than five thousand years. The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience and perseverance, but also of hubris, arrogance and misperception, all leveraged against a disease that, just three decades ago, was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out &#39;war against cancer&#39; . Emperor of All Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through toxic, bruising, and draining regimes to survive and to increase the store of human knowledge. Riveting and magisterial, The Emperor of All Maladies provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer treatments and a brilliant new perspective on the way doctors, scientists, philosophers and lay people have observed and understood the human body for millennia.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2010</strong>: "In 2010, about six hundred thousand Americans, and more than 7 million humans around the world, will die of cancer." With this sobering statistic, physician and researcher Siddhartha Mukherjee begins his comprehensive and eloquent "biography" of one of the most virulent diseases of our time. An exhaustive account of cancer's origins, <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> illustrates how modern treatments--multi-pronged chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, as well as preventative care--came into existence thanks to a century's worth of research, trials, and small, essential breakthroughs around the globe. While <i>The Emperor of All Maladies</i> is rich with the science and history behind the fight against cancer, it is also a meditation on illness, medical ethics, and the complex, intertwining lives of doctors and patients. Mukherjee's profound compassion--for cancer patients, their families, as well as the oncologists who, all too often, can offer little hope--makes this book a very human history of an elusive and complicated disease. <em>--Lynette Mong</em><br> <br>Siddhartha Mukherjee M.D., Ph.D., is a cancer physician and researcher.

On the American side, most of the fighting was done by the inexperienced troops of the Army's 43rd Division, commanded in turn by Major-Generals John Hester and John Hodge. After a two-month campaign in the summer of 1943, the heavily outnumbered and outgunned Japanese were forced to retreat. Hammel, author of many military histories, writes here of a relatively uninterest ing campaign, one with unimaginative tactics on both sides and with piecemeal commitment of U.S. forces. About the only feature that distinguished the campaign was widespread "combat fatigue," a condition which, according to Hammel, was first defined and diagnosed at New Georgia. And unlike other historians, he fails to note that the level of leadership and soldiering alike was so poor during the early part of the campaign that demoralization was inevitable. Photos. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Early in World War II, after the Japanese Pacific drive had been checked at Guadalcanal, both sides turned their attention to the Solomon Islands. It was on the island of New Georgia of this chain that a relatively untried U.S. Army division clashed with the Japanese for control of the strategic island corridor. Here in swamps and rain forests, the term "jungle warfare" took on a new and sinister meaning, and the concept of combat fatigue was first defined and diagnosed. While Hammel describes the campaign in detail, this is primarily a rehash of secondary sources, not an in-depth analysis. There are no footnotes and the bibliography is rather thin.

But with this knowledge comes responsibility. What they&#39;ve learned about survival could transform the planet--or, if entrusted to the wrong hands, bring about its destruction.

The whirling blades raised such a dust storm, Jakkin had to squint to see through the windows, and still the world outside seemed filled with sand and grit.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Home . . ." </i>Akki sent Jakkin the single word as they landed, her mind decorating the sending with a picture of the nursery: gray stone surrounded by red sky, which lay beyond the sand and grit. She pushed a strand of dark hair back from her forehead and pressed her face against the window.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Home," </i>Jakkin answered, his sending the blue of the five rivers twisting through tan sands. A cooler reaction, almost as if he were afraid. Only he wasn&#x2019;t afraid, just being cautious. It was an old habit, but a good one.<p></p><b> </b>As Golden&#x2019;s slim hands danced across the console of lights, the blades slowed, then stilled. "Good landing," Golden said. Then he turned and grinned at them. "Even if you two don&#x2019;t know the difference."<p></p><b> </b>Soon the dust settled. A minute more and Jakkin could see through the grit that the landscape was neither as red and gray&#x2014;or as tan and blue&#x2014;as their sendings.<p></p><b> </b>Akki laughed&#x2014;a soft, delightful sound&#x2014;and Jakkin was reminded of other times she &#x2019;d sounded like that. Not many recently; hardly any when they were on the run in the mountains, and none at all in the caves of the trogs. But he remembered them all.<p></p><b> </b>Overhead, Heart&#x2019;s Blood&#x2019;s five&#x2014;Sssargon, Sssasha, Trisss, Trisssha, and Trissskkette&#x2014;wheeled away, disappearing behind a cluster of trees. In his mind, Jakkin heard them bidding a good-bye, their sendings as bright and fluffy as clouds.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Sssargon goesss. Sssargon fliesss high," </i>sent the largest, and only male. As ever, his sendings were full of himself. And full of what he was doing now. Dragon time was always now. They could remember a trainer, their hatchlings, their nest. They could be taught enough movements to fight warily in a pit. They could recall where a particularly fine patch of wort existed. But otherwise they lived in the now. Still, they&#x2019;d been able to hold on to enough to bring Golden to the rescue, to guide him to where Jakkin and Akki had been on the run from the trogs who slaughtered dragons in their caves.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Thanks, my friends." </i>Jakkin&#x2019;s sending to the dragons was open-ended, brightly colored. Those dragons were the one constant in Jakkin&#x2019;s life besides Akki. He hoped they weren&#x2019;t going far. They linked his past and present, sky and earth, nursery and the wilds. <i>"Good flying, my friends." </i>They were behind the trees, so he couldn&#x2019;t see them any-more. Couldn&#x2019;t hear them, either. But just in case, he called out again with his mind, <i>"Fair wind."<p></p></i><b> </b>A sunny image flittered back to him, actually more like a brain tickle. <i>So at least one of them heard. Probably Sssasha, always the sunny one.<p></p></i><b> </b>"Here we are," Golden said, flicking the last switches on the console. Turning his head, he nodded at Jakkin and Akki, his river-colored eyes glinting at them. "Home. The nursery. Back where your life begins."<p></p><b> </b>It was unclear if he was making a joke or a simple statement. Jakkin had never been able to read Golden easily, and unlike the dragons&#x2019; minds, Golden&#x2019;s was closed. Of course Jakkin knew that humans had closed minds, but it was something he would have to get used to, now that they were back.<p></p><b> </b><i>Back home.<p></p></i><b> </b>Unbuckling his seat belt, Golden stood and stretched. Walking to the copter door, he pushed it open, then flicked a switch that unfolded a set of stairs. Descending the steps backward, he signaled Jakkin and Akki to follow the same way.<p></p><b> </b>As Jakkin climbed down from the copter, he looked over his shoulder. The shock of it all&#x2014;gates, wood-and stone walls, dusty yard, and the blue water in the weir&#x2014; seemed overwhelmingly like a dream. So self-contained, so comfortable, so . . . familiar.<p></p><b> </b>He and Akki had been living for a year as outlaws, exiles. Running, hiding, afraid all the time. Well, maybe not <i>all </i>of the time, but a lot of the time. Living in caves, without real beds. Worrying about where their next meal would come from. How often he &#x2019;d dreamed about coming home to the nursery, but he &#x2019;d never really believed it could ever happen. Too many people with too many grievances were still looking for them. Like the Austar wardens who wanted to put them in jail; the rebels who wanted to kill them outright.<p></p><b> </b>Yet according to Golden, all that was no longer true. At least the rebels were satisfied, the wardens, too. Jakkin set his lips together. Not that he mistrusted Golden, but it seemed too good to be . . .<p></p><b> </b>Now, of course, they had another problem&#x2014;the trogs in the caves probably wanted Jakkin and Akki dead, because they didn&#x2019;t want the secret of their caves to come out. And they probably wanted their two dragons back as well.<p></p><b> </b><i>I regret none of that, </i>Jakkin thought. <i>None.<p></p></i><b> </b>And none of the past year, either. Oh, it had been a hard year. But, though hard, life in the mountains had given both Jakkin and Akki a taste for freedom. He mulled that over. <i>A taste for freedom.<p></p></i><b> </b>He hadn&#x2019;t realized he&#x2019;d sent it till Akki answered him. <i>"And a hunger for home."<p></p></i><b> </b>Jakkin nodded. Many times he&#x2019;d been sure they would die up in the mountains, with only Heart&#x2019;s Blood&#x2019;s hatchlings to mourn them.<p></p><b> </b><i>"And Sssargon to comment on it all." </i>This time there was a bubbling laugh in Akki&#x2019;s sending.<p></p><b> </b><i>But home? </i>He&#x2019;d never really believed they could return.<p></p><b> </b>Reaching solid ground, Jakkin turned, then stared at the dragon nursery. Without realizing what he was doing, he rubbed the thin bracelet of scar tissue on his wrist. The whole of that year in the mountains, he&#x2019;d tried to keep his deepest longings for the nursery shielded so that Akki couldn&#x2019;t read his heartache and add it to her own. Now that they were actually back, he felt he should be elated. What he actually felt was . . .<p></p><b> </b><i>"Scared?" </i>Akki&#x2019;s sending was tentative, wavery, like the water at the bottom of the falls.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Stay out of my mind!" </i>he answered, with black and gold arrow points. Sharper than he meant. To soften it, he turned back and reached a hand up to help her down, for she was facing forward as she came down the steps, carefully cradling the young dragon hatchling. Its back and belly were still patch worked with the last of its gray eggskin, and it looped its tail securely around her wrist.<p></p><b> </b>"Thanks," she whispered to Jakkin, and smiled&#x2014;a tremulous, tentative smile. It said even more than her sending.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Scared."<p></p></i><b> </b>This time the sending was not Akki&#x2019;s. Anxiously, Jakkin looked around. Finally he spotted the sender&#x2014;Auricle, the pale red adult dragon they&#x2019;d brought out of the caves before she could be sacrificed by the trogs. She was crouched on the far side of the nursery yard, tail twitching. Not one of Heart&#x2019;s Blood&#x2019;s brood, she was possibly a cousin, for her color and sendings were reminiscent of the red dragon&#x2019;s. He and Akki had gotten her out of the caves just in time. Into the air. Showed her that she could fly, that she could be free.<p></p><b> </b>Auricle&#x2019;s neck arched downward and her neck scales fluttered, which meant that any moment she might bolt. <i>It&#x2019;s astonishing that she&#x2019;s landed here and not actually flown off with the others,</i> Jakkin thought. In <i>her </i>mind, men were not safe. Not even her rescuers. <i>Not Akki. Not me.<p></p></i><b> </b><i>"Here?" </i>Jakkin hadn&#x2019;t meant to send the question, blue, stuttering, but Auricle caught a glimpse of it anyway.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Here," </i>she answered in the same color, but even more faded. The membranes on her eyes closed, effectively shuttering them.<p></p><b> </b>Jakkin&#x2019;s thoughts followed one another in quick succession: Auricle was probably <i>here </i>because she wasn&#x2019;t used to flying, having been kept in that underground prison the whole of her life except for the one time when she was bred. Or perhaps she was <i>here </i>because Akki had the dragonling. Or because she was exhausted. Or because she was . . .<p></p><b> </b><i>"Scared."<p></p></i><b> </b><i>"Gentle Auricle." </i>This time Jakkin&#x2019;s blue sending was edged about with soft beige billows. <i>"Do not be afraid. We are with thee. Soon thee will be altogether safe." </i>Dragon masters in the nursery always spoke that way to their charges, "thee" and "thou." Jakkin didn&#x2019;t know why. It was just how things were done. And it certainly calmed them down.<p></p><b> </b>Auricle lifted her head slightly. Her eyes were dark but without the fire of a fighting dragon. Even if she hadn&#x2019;t sent her fear to him, he would have known it by her posture: the crouch, the lashing tail, the shuttered eyes. She was afraid of the copter, of the nursery, of the memory of the trogs. Well, she had a right to be afraid of the trogs. <i>I&#x2019;m afraid of them, too.<p></p></i><b> </b>"Jakkin!" Akki&#x2019;s voice gave a warning.<p></p><b> </b>He thought she meant he was broadcasting his own fear to the terrified Auricle, but Akki was pointing in a different direction. He turned, caught something out of the corner of his eye, and startled, before realizing that the door of the bondhouse had flown open.<p></p><b> </b>Out ran the fat cook, Kkarina, though it was more like a fast waddle. Her haste was understandable. Any copter was a rare sight at the nursery. Usually the appearance of one meant bad news. Wiping her hands nervously on her long apron, Kkarina stared at Golden, who was standing several steps away from the copter&#x2019;s blades. Her hands left dark red stains on the white cloth of her apron, stains that could have been either takk or blood.<p></p><b> </b>Jakkin licked his lips, just thinking about a cup of takk, the taste a sudden vivid recollection in his mouth. After a year of drinking boil&#x2014;that thin soup made from greasy skagg grass&#x2014;he was more than ready for takk. A whole pot of it. Two whole pots of it! And then he remembered what it was made of&#x2014;dragon&#x2019;s blood. <i>"It&#x2019;s back to boil," </i>he sent Akki, at the same time including a picture of him bathing in a pot of the gray-green stuff. Akki broke into sudden, nervous laughter.<p></p><b> </b>Hearing Akki&#x2019;s laugh, Kkarina gasped, her face an alarming crimson. She turned and finally registered who Golden&#x2019;s passengers were. Without warning, she burst into tears and threw her apron up over her head.<p></p><b> </b>"Kkarina," Akki said with a sweetness Jakkin hadn&#x2019;t heard from her in a while, "Kay&#x2014;it&#x2019;s me." That set the old woman to crying even harder.<p></p><b> </b>Still sobbing, the cook lowered her apron, waddled up to them, and gathered up Akki and Jakkin in her massive arms, which threatened to break bones and bring bruises. Kkarina smelled of fresh bread and sharp takk, and something burnt.<i><p></p></i><b> </b><i>She smells of home. </i>His knees suddenly buckled. <i>Home.<p></p></i><b> </b>"Oh, oh, oh . . ." Kkarina said over and over. "Oh, oh, oh," without letting go of either of them.<p></p><b> </b>At last Akki cried out, "Kkarina, you&#x2019;re crushing me&#x2014;<i>and </i>the dragonling." It was true. The old cook had enfolded all three of them in her hard embrace.<p></p><b> </b>Jakkin was incapable of speech.<p></p><b> </b>"Oh, oh, oh," Kkarina said one more time, then let them go.<p></p><b> </b>Again, out of the corner of his eye, Jakkin saw movement, this time on his right. He stepped in front of Akki, to shield her, before realizing it was only old Balakk, the plowman, coming in from the fields. Next to him was Trikko and someone else, a moonfaced boy with stringy blond hair whom Jakkin didn&#x2019;t recognize.<p></p><b> </b>Balakk had spotted the copter, then Jakkin and Akki, and began complaining even before he was close. They had to strain to hear him. "All those days of mourning," he started. "And me hardly able to work, thinking about you two dead out there in the mountains in the cold. Little Jakkin, little Akki." Though of course neither of them had been little&#x2014;then or now. Indeed, they hadn&#x2019;t been little for quite some time. And of course neither of them had been dead, though how was poor Balakk to have known?<p></p><b> </b>Jakkin stared at Balakk&#x2019;s moonfaced companion, wondering who he was, how he &#x2019;d gotten to the nursery. Of course, a year was a long time to be away. People could die, move to the city, be sent offworld. People could grow old, forgetful, take on new apprentices. People could change.<p></p><b> </b>"We apologize for being both alive and well," Akki said, but with a smile to take away the sting of it.<p></p><b> </b>The dragonling resettled itself, curling up so tightly in Akki&#x2019;s arms, it was almost a dragon ball. At this point, it seemed to regard Akki as its mother.<p></p><b> </b><i>That would be funny, </i>Jakkin thought, <i>if it weren&#x2019;t so . . . so inconvenient. </i>The hatchling had imprinted on Akki early and refused to be parted from her.<p></p><b> </b>Trikko winked at Jakkin as if to say the year away had simply been a ploy to be alone with Akki, but then Trikko&#x2019;s mind always worked that way, from the slightly off-color to the positively filthy. <i>He couldn&#x2019;t, </i>Jakkin thought, <i>understand real love.<p></p></i><b> </b>But looking confused, Balakk turned to Golden, spread his hands, palms to the sky. His new helper touched his arm, as if in comfort. At the same time, a roar from the stud barn made them all turn around. A male dragon, sensing roiling emotion nearby, was simply trying to bring the attention to himself. It was an old dragon trick, and as usual, it worked.<p></p><b> </b>"Typical male," Akki said with an exaggerated eye roll, which broke the tension, and they all laughed&#x2014;even Jakkin.<p></p><b> </b>Only Auricle still seemed perturbed; her sending to Jakkin was laced with red spots that looked a great deal like blood.<p></p><b> </b><i>"Danger?"<p></p></i><b> </b><i>"No danger," </i>he answered soothingly.<p></p><b> </b>"How?" asked Kkarina, meaning how were they still alive?<p></p><b> </b>"When . . . where?" Balakk added, waving a hand.<p></p><b> </b>Trikko&#x2019;s knowing smile spread slowly across his face.<p></p><b> </b>The answers to any of those questions had to be given carefully. Guardedly. Because there <i>was </i>danger, great danger, even if he &#x2019;d just assured Auricle there was none. He and Akki had to be certain that they said the same things, that their versions of the past year&#x2019;s adventures matched exactly. If not, the future of all the dragons on Austar IV could be a bloody one indeed.<p></p><b> </b><i>"If the secret gets out&#x2014;our secret . . ." </i>he thought, adding, <i>"Akki, take care."<p></p></i><b> </b><i>"I&#x2019;m not stupid," </i>she shot back, the red lightning bolt accompanying it lancing through his mind with such force, he almost winced. <i>"But there&#x2019;s no way it can get out unless you tell. Me&#x2014;I&#x2019;m silent as the grave." </i>Facing him directly, so that no one else could see, she lifted her hand to her mouth, then surreptitiously drew her finger across her throat. <i>"See&#x2014;dead, grave, got it?" </i>Afterward, she smiled broadly at Kkarina, at Balakk and his helper, at Golden, even at Trikko.

From creating brand value to fine-tuning customer service, the folks running cartels have been attentive students of the strategy and tactics used by corporations such as Walmart, McDonald's, and Coca-Cola.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what can government learn to combat this scourge? By analyzing the cartels as companies, law enforcers might better understand how they work and stop throwing away 100 billion a year in a futile effort to win the war&#x201d; against this global, highly organized business.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your intrepid guide to the most exotic and brutal industry on earth is Tom Wainwright. Picking his way through Andean cocaine fields, Central American prisons, Colorado pot shops, and the online drug dens of the Dark Web, Wainwright provides a fresh, innovative look into the drug trade and its 250 million customers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cast of characters includes Bin Laden,&#x201d; the Bolivian coca guide; Old Lin,&#x201d; the Salvadoran gang leader; Starboy,&#x201d; the millionaire New Zealand pill maker; and a cozy Mexican grandmother who cooks blueberry pancakes while plotting murder. Along with presidents, cops, and teenage hitmen, they explain such matters as the business purpose for head-to-toe tattoos, how gangs decide whether to compete or collude, and why cartels care a surprising amount about corporate social responsibility.<br>More than just an investigation of how drug cartels do business, <i>Narconomics</i> is also a blueprint for how to defeat them.<br></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of February 2016:</strong> Chances are when you hear someone talking about the drug trade what comes to mind is an image from T.V. or the movies&#x2014;seedy dealers, million-dollar busts, films like <em>Traffic</em> and shows like <em>The Wire</em>. In <em>Narconomics</em>, author Tom Wainwright looks at the drug business as...a business. And it&#x2019;s fascinating. We already know how internet shopping has changed the way people buy and sell goods, but in the course of his research Wainwright learned that all manner of illegal drugs are increasingly being bought and sold online, too. Interesting, right? Just wait until you read how customer service and product quality have been impacted by this change... And this is just one of the many ways in which an economist&#x2019;s view paints a very different picture than the one we&#x2019;re used to seeing. Wainwright&#x2019;s fresh look at a decades-old problem shows not only how the narcotics industry is run, but also how the &#x201c;war on drugs&#x201d; could be more effective if law enforcement started thinking about the drug business as just another corporate jungle. <em>--Seira Wilson</em><b>Tom Wainwright</b> is the Britain editor of The <i>Economist</i>.

Refreshing and insightful, this is an homage to brave women past and present, and an invitation to all women to write their own scripts, whatever they may be.</p><p>With subtlety and great eloquence, Carolyn Heilbrun shows how, throughout the centuries, those who write about women's lives--biographers <i>and</i>autobiographers--have suppressed the truth of the female experience, in order to make the "written life" conform to the expectations of what that life should be. Heilbrun also examines literature's silence on such vital topics as friendship between women, the female physical experience, and the richness that often imbues a women's later years. Recommended reading for everyone, especially women and writers.Carolyn G. Heilbrun (1926&#x2013;2003) was a professor of English at Columbia University. A force in literary and feminist theory, she also wrote mysteries under the pen name Amanda Cross.</p><h2>Sorrows of an Exile: Tristia (The World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>In AD 8 Ovid's brilliant career was abruptly ruined when the Emperor Augustus banished him, for reasons never satisfactorily explained, to Tomis (Constanta) on the Black Sea. The five books of <em>Tristia</em> (Sorrows) express his reaction to this savage and, as he clearly regarded it, unjust sentence. Though their ostensible theme is the misery and loneliness of exile, their real message, if they are read with the care they deserve, is one of affirmation. With a wit and irony that borders on defiance, Ovid repeatedly asserts the injustice of his sentence and of the preeminence of the eternal values of poetry over the ephemeral dictates of an earthly power. In technical skill and inventiveness these elegies rank with the <em>Art of Love</em> or the <em>Fasti</em>. For this new translation Alan Melville has reproduced, in rhyming stanzas, the virtuosity, wit, and elegance of the original.</p><p>In AD 8 Ovid&#39;s brilliant career was abruptly blasted when the Emperor Augustus banished him, for reasons never satisfactorily explained, to Tomis (Constanta) on the Black Sea. The five books of Tristia (Sorrows) express his reaction to this savage and, as he clearly regarded it, unjust sentence. Their title belies them. Though their ostensible theme is the misery and loneliness of exile, their real message, if they are read with the care they deserve, is one of affirmation. Both directly and, as befitted the Roman Callimachus, allusively, Ovid repeatedly asserts, often with a wit and irony that borders on defiance, his conviction of the injustice of his sentence and of the pre-eminence of the eternal values of poetry over the ephemeral dictates of an earthly power. These elegies are throughout informed by Ovid&#39;s awareness of a continuing pride in his poetic identity and mission. In technical skill and inventiveness, they rank with the Art of Love or the Fasti. This is poetry as accomplished as anything he had written in happier days and demands no less critical respect. For this new translation of Ovid&#39;s poems, all of which are in elegiacs, Alan Melville has used the same system of rhyming stanzas that he evolved so successfully for Ovid&#39;s Love Poems. Here again he has reproduced the virtuosity, elegance, and wit of the original, and presents a collection of poems in which the reader will find continual interest and pleasure.E. J.

The American photographer was on his way home from Afghanistan. The Spanish painter was sitting in his bathtub at home in the south of France: Voil�! . . . the first Picasso photograph of tens of thousands taken during the next seventeen years when David Douglas Duncan often shared the simple meals, the constant work, the gaiety, the countless explosions of creativity. After other guests had gone, Duncan still remained in the studio - by now his second home. Thus was born a friendship unique in the lives of both men. Two minds, two hearts, each discovering a special communication with the other. While photographing hundreds of Picasso&#39;s paintings, Duncan also recorded many of the emotion-charged events at the heart of the household. Now, from this once in each lifetime relationship, we have the third, ultimate book which Duncan has created dealing with his neighbor, Pablo Picasso. It is at once a profoundly personal story of the last years of the great painter, an enrichening journey of discovery through the canvases he withheld during his lifetime and a photographic epic born of the comradeship shared between two men, whose separate images of the world have changed our own way of perceiving. Goodbye Picasso reveals the simplicity and genius of Picasso&#39;s life and art. Seeing Pablo Picasso and his work through the eyes and heart of David Douglas Duncan is seeing Picasso perhaps as the ages will come to know him best.

Stories of the Jewish Holidays</h2><p>Lively watercolor illustrations complement a family treasury of retellings of Bible stories, recipes, craft projects, a historical map, and commentary that introduces young readers to the eight major Jewish holidays through engaging activities.</p><p>The Jewish holidays are called the "jewels in the crown" of the Jewish year. This jewel of a collection by respected author Gilda Berger is a celebration of Jewish traditions, including Bible stories, time lines, recipes, crafts, and commentaries on the holidays. Each chapter covers one Jewish holiday, with a retelling of a related story from the Bible, followed by sections called "What We Celebrate," "How We Celebrate," and "Crafts and Food." A time line in each chapter places the origins of that holiday in its historical context, and a map of the Middle East and a complete index are also included. Glowing paintings by Peter Catalanotto introduce and follow each Bible story. The crafts and recipes are written with careful, simple directions, illustrated with clear diagrams when appropriate. Children (with a little help from an adult) can make a homemade dreidel or menorah, stir up a batch of latkes or cheese blintzes, or create Purim puppets with the directions given here. The author's goal in writing this book was to create one source that could be used by families throughout the year at each Jewish holiday. A superb choice for Jewish families or anyone interested in learning more about these ancient traditions. (Age 4 to adult) <i>--Marcie Bovetz</i>Did you know that every major annual Jewish holiday plus the weekly holiday, Shabbat, is linked to a story from the Bible? A lively retelling of the brave deeds of such favorite heroes as Queen Esther and Moses opens each of the eight chapters and lays the foundations for the holiday celebrations. Three sections follow each story. WHAT WE CELEBRATE explores the background of the holidays. HOW WE CELEBRATE describes traditional ways of observing the holidays. CRAFTS AND FOOD provides hands-on activities, complete with easy-to-follow recipes and instructions, to bring more depth and fun to the holiday experience.<p> Gilda Berger's seamless retellings and thoughtful commentary will fascinate and enlighten, as she breathes life into these favorite old tales and illuminates the modern-day significance of ancient traditions. In perfect complement, Peter Catalanatto's exquisitely rendered paintings glow with warmth and emotion. A true family treasury in the Jewish storytelling tradition, <i>Celebrate!</i> is meant to be shared among children, parents, and grandparents throughout the year.</p></p><h2>A Yorkshire Fable: Thirty Knitting Designs</h2><p>Drop everything and start knitting with these 30 superb tweed knitting patterns inspired by the Yorkshire textile region of England.

Dr. Peirera, an editor at a second-rate Lisbon newspaper, wants nothing to do with European politics. He&#39;s happy to translate 19th-century French stories. His closest confidante is a photograph of his late wife. All this changes when he meets Francesco Monteiro Rossi, an oddly charismatic young man. Pereira gives Rossi work, and continues to pay him, even after discovering that he is using the money to recruit for the anti-Franco International Brigade. PEREIRA MAINTAINS chronicles Pereira&#39;s ascent to consciousness, culminating in a devastating and reckless act of rebellion.</p><p>Antonio Tabucchi was born in Pisa in 1943. Tabucchi authored twenty critically acclaimed novels and short story collections, nine of which have been translated into English, together with numerous essays and plays. Twice shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize, he has been awarded many prestigious prizes, including the Prix Medicis etranger for Indian Nocturne and the Premio Campiello, the Premio Viareggio and the Aristeion Prize for Pereira Maintains. Tabucchi was Emeritus professor at the University of Siena, and also taught at Bard College in New York, the Ecole de Hautes Etudes and the College de France in Paris. He died in March 2012.A masterpiece of compression. A political history of 1930s Portugal, a love story between a man and his dead wife, a gloriously successful formal experiment, and an irresistible thriller - and it can be read with enormous pleasure in a single afternoon. -- Mohsin Hamid Pereira Maintains is small only in size. Its themes are great ones - courage, betrayal, fidelity, love, corruption; and its treatment of them is subtle, skilful, and clear. It's so clear, in fact, that you can see a very long way down, into the heart of a flawed but valiant human being, into the sickness of a nation, into the depths of political evil. It's the most impressive novel I've read for years, and one of the very few that feels truly necessary. -- Philip Pullman Close to being a perfect novel - brief, tragic, inspiring -- John Carey, Chairman of the International Man Booker 2002 Pereira is a marvelously complex creation. One of the most intriguing and appealing character studies in recent European fiction. * * Kirkus Reviews * * Every word of Mohsin Hamid's introduction is true: it's a stunningly good novel, and it goes on getting better in one's head after one has stopped reading it - it works as an experience - something that has happened to one, which is of course, the proof of great writing. -- Diana Athill It grips from start to finish....a riveting political allegory * * Financial Times * * Tabucchi writes...with an agility of mind and an economy of narrative that pulls the reader along * * Observer * * Political but gorgeously artful, sad and then laugh out loud funny, pacy as a thriller ....This book is perfectly executed * * Dazed and Confused * * This novel...has been sensitively and intelligently translated revealing this understated masterpiece of love and courage. * * Good Book Guide * * [A] succinct, deceptively low-key political thriller...it's brilliant and you'll go on thinking about the characters and the way it's written for weeks. -- Sue Arnold * * Guardian * * Concise, intense and striking. * * Daily Telegraph * * Seemingly plain at first, the story becomes gripping as soon as you realize that the beauty of Tabucchi's narrative lies in between the lines, making the novel a thought-provoking and delightful read. -- Maria-Christina Marchi * * Time Out * * A powerfully concise story of heroism versus acquiescence which gains eloquence from its simplicity * * Sunday Telegraph * * Tabucchi's book (widely interpreted as a critique of Berlusconi) niggles away at the ambiguous space between aggrieved resistance and passive inaction * * Guardian * * In its quiet, brilliant way, this is a novel you will read carefully. It is subtle and powerful; it deserves to be a classic. * * Scotsman * * A moving intellectual thriller * * London Magazine * * subtle and powerful; it deserves to be a classic -- William Leith * * The Scotsman * * gripping * * Baby &amp; Me * * A masterpiece . . . Romantic, devastating, thrilling and formally inventive -- Mohsin Hamid * * Esquire Magazine * * At once a thrilling mystery, a literary inquiry, and a meditation on politics and fascism, this novel about an overweight journalist in 1930s Portugal amazed me with its compression and use of the testimonial form. Close to perfection. -- Mohsin Hamid * * The Week * *</p><h2>Prayers That Changed History: From Christopher Columbus to Helen Keller, how God used 25 people to change the world</h2><p><p>One prayer can change everything, says bestselling author Tricia Goyer in&nbsp;<em>Prayers That Changed History</em>.</p><p>Martin Luther. Sojourner Truth. Helen Keller. St. Patrick. We read their stories, and of other people like them, in history books and hear about the amazing things they did to change the world. But one part of the story is often left out: Each one of them wouldn&#x2019;t have accomplished what they did without prayer.</p><p>In<em>&nbsp;</em><em>Prayers That Changed History</em>, the stories of twenty-five notable people are presented along with how prayer changed their lives and changed history. Following each historical example is a biblical story that ties to that person&#x2019;s life and actions, as well as ways you can use the power of prayer in your life as well. Because God isn&#x2019;t done changing the world yet, and he would love to use you to make history.</p><p>Includes images of each historical figure.</p></p><p><p><em>USA TODAY</em> bestselling author Tricia Goyer is the author of more than 40 books, including the novelization for Moms&#x2019; Night Out.

Visit Tricia online at triciagoyer.com; Facebook: authortriciagoyer; Instagram: triciagoyer; Twitter: @triciagoyer.</p>In Prayers that Changed History, Tricia Goyer introduces 25 historical figures and the significant role of prayer in their lives. Each concise chapter presents a notable individual whose prayers for strength and guidance had far-reaching consequences. Arranged chronologically, the characters span a wide swath of history from the first century (Polycarp) to the twentieth (Dietrich Bonhoeffer) and include the familiar (Christopher Columbus, Florence Nightingale, Helen Keller) as well as the lesser-known (Robert Raikes, George M�ller, Billy Sunday). The British people of WWII are recognized collectively. Author Tricia Goyer employs a narrative style with imagined dialogue that is likely to hold the interest and attention of independent readers. Her intent to show &#x201c;prayer-at-work&#x201d; is achieved through these compelling biographic profiles, biblical parallels, and referenced sources. &#x201c;Something to Think About&#x201d; and &#x201c;Your Life&#x201d; headings direct readers to reflect, discuss, and relate personally to the power of prayer. Though suggested for a grade and middle school audience, Prayers that Changed History would be a compelling and enjoyable book for all ages, particularly history enthusiasts. Some of the chapters include more mature themes such as the suicide of Adolf Hitler, Nazi death camps, the &#x201c;red light&#x201d; district of Chicago, and the enslavement of young girls in India. Small photos, graphics, and text boxes, use of varied font, and an easy-to-follow table of contents adds to the pleasant readability of this enlightening book. Nina Ditmar, CLJ (<i>Christian Library Journal</i>)<br><br>It might be hard to make the power of prayer accessible to young readers, but it&#x2019;s even harder to make it entertaining. Goyer succeeds on both fronts in her anthology of 24 Christian individuals (plus the British people of WWII) who, she contends, changed the course of history through prayer. Arranged chronologically, the profiles feature such famous figures as Sojourner Truth, Helen Keller, and Mother Teresa as well as such lesser-known but equally important figures as John Newton, who found God&#x2019;s mercy during a near-death experience aboard a ship and began to see the evils of the slave trade. Each profile begins with a short fictionalized narrative that describes a difficult situation and how prayer helped the individual overcome the adversity. Although thought-provoking, the author doesn&#x2019;t indicate that she is reimaging scenes from history. She follows with questions that connect the reader to the narrative, direct quotes, biblical connections on the same theme, and inspirational guided prayer topics. While geared for Christian readers, history buffs will also enjoy the unique angle. --- Angela Leeper (<i>Booklist</i>)</p><h2>I Know What You Did Last Summer (Lois Duncan Thrillers)</h2><p><b><i>Some secrets just won't stay buried.</i></b><br><br>They didn't mean it.

The dark lie is unearthed, and before the four friends know it they need to outsmart a killer...or they will be the next to die.<br><br>Leave the lights on when reading this classic thriller! This new edition features modernized text and a new introduction by Lois Duncan, the master of teen horror.</p><p>It was only an accident -- but it would change their lives forever. Last summer, four terrified friends made a desperate pact to conceal a shocking secret. But some secrets don&#39;t stay buried, and someone has learned the truth. Someone bent on revenge. This summer, the horror is only beginning...."A taut, skillfully plotted and suspenseful thriller." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever: The Making of a Happy Woman</h2><p><p></p><blockquote><em>"My father was a kidder, and he could usually make me laugh; in laughing I was able to feel better about myself. He also gave me a piece of advice about beauty that has stayed with me. 'Beauty fades' he used to say, 'but dumb? Dumb is forever.' "</em></blockquote><p>Judge Judy's father impressed upon her that a bright intellect, a curious mind, and a passion for learning are priceless commodities. "For as long as I can remember," she writes, "the worst insult someone could give me was to say 'You're stupid.' In fact to this day, it's second nature for me when I'm on the bench to point a finger to the side of my head and ask, 'Does it say stupid here?' "--the implied answer being a resounding no.</p><p>In the course of her career as a family court judge and a presiding judge on the popular courtroom show that bears her name, Judge Judy has seen over and over again, the devastating fallout for women who have made stupid choices on marriage, parenting and their future. She has seen women make excuses for me who abuse them and women who tolerate demeaning and demoralizing conditions at work. She has seen women who, instead of choosing mates, allowed themselves to be chosen. She has seen women who elected to defer to men instead of their own judgment.</p><p>Here, the savvy, opinionated, and irrepressible Judge Judy exposes, with her trademark wit and wisdom, these dirty little secrets so many women share and offers her own take on the destructive repercussions they have on women. Using real cases involving women of every background--from the most affluent and successful to young girls just starting out--as well as stories from her own life, Judge Judy shows women how to fix their attitude and, equally important, how to teach their daughters to follow their dreams by keeping their individuality intact.</p><p>As a judge, wife, mother, and grandmother, judge Judy understands the lasting currency of self-esteem and independence, and when she voices her tough-minded opinions daily in her courtroom, everyone listens. In <em>Beauty Fades, Dumb is Forever,</em> she instills in women--with the help of provocative and hilarious examples from her own life--the urgency of building a solid foundation within. On building character. On nourishing yourself. On learning from mistakes and fighting battles you can't win. On understanding what sex can and cannot do for you. On the importance of humor and self reliance. Her straight talk tells women to get on with it and never forget that <em>smart is forever, too.</em></p></p><p>Judge Judy Sheindlin established herself as a tough but fair judge in New York's family court. She is the presiding judge for <em>Judge Judy,</em> a nationally syndicated daily television show based on real court cases, and the author of two best-selling adult books and a children's book. She lives in New York City with her husband, Jerry, a New York Supreme Court Judge. She is the mother of five and a grandmother of four.With the same in-your-face style that has made her television show a hit, &#34;Judge Judy&#34; provides some of her views on the need for women to become self-reliant. Fans of her show will certainly not be surprised by her opinions or manner of presentation.

Boone knew that there was no place on this earth for him now; no happiness here, not even with Lori. He would let Hell claim him, let Death take him there. But Death itself seemed to shrink from Boone. No wonder, if he had indeed been the monster who had shattered, violated and shredded so many others&#39; lives. And Decker had shown him the proof -- the hellish photographs where the last victims were forever stilled, splayed in the last obscene moment of their torture. Boone&#39;s only refuge now was Midian -- that awful, legendary place in which gathered the half-dead, the Nightbreed!</p><p>For more than two decades, Clive Barker has twisted the worlds of horrific and surrealistic fiction into a terrifying, transcendent genre all his own. With skillful prose, he enthralls even as he horrifies; with uncanny insight, he disturbs as profoundly as he reveals.

Dr Michelle P. Brown analyses the production of the manuscripts, setting them in their historical context and relating them to the people who produced them. Patricia Lovett uses the manuscripts to analyse the letter-forms in detail, and then gives clear guidance on how to write the letters. Each section includes a calligraphic interpretation of the historic letter-form.</p><p>This book is the first to put the needs of the historian and the scribe at the forefront. Large-scale examples of the manuscripts are included for letter analysis, with, in most instances, a full page colour reproduction of a page from the same manuscript alongside. Other selected manuscripts with clear letter-forms show the development of that alphabet style throughout the periods under consideration. A whole page is devoted to exemplar letters of each alphabet style, with clear guidelines on how the letters are formed, including punctuation marks, an ampersand (or et ligature) and numerals. Each section includes a specially created piece of modern calligraphy, showing how the hand can be used today.</p></p><p><b>Michelle P.

It concerned a very optimistic young boy who happened upon a huge pile of horse manure and began digging excitedly. When someone asked him what he was doing covered in muck, the foolish boy answered brightly, &#x2018;There must be a pony in here somewhere!&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2014;From the Prologue<br><br>If you&#x2019;re wondering what happened after &#x201c;a company without assets acquired a company without a clue,&#x201d; as Kara Swisher wryly writes, it&#x2019;s time to crack open this trenchant book about the doomed merger of America Online and Time Warner. On a quest to discover how the deal of the century became the messiest merger in history, Swisher delivers a rollicking narrative and a keen analysis of this debacle that is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand what it all means for the digital future. Packed with new revelations and on-the-record interviews with key players, it is the first detailed examination of the merger&#x2019;s aftermath and also looks forward to what is coming next.<br><br>It certainly has not been a pretty picture so far&#x2014;with $100 billion in losses, a sinking stock price, employees in revolt, and lawsuits galore. As Swisher writes, &#x201c;It is hard not to feel a bit queasy about the whole sorry mess. . . . It felt a bit like I was watching someone fall down a flight of stairs in slow motion, and every bump and thump made me wince. It made me reassess old ideas and wonder what I had gotten wrong. And it left me deeply confused as to what had happened and, more important, what was coming next.&#x201d;<br><br>For Swisher, finding the answers to what went awry is important because she remains a staunch believer in the digital future&#x2014;maybe not in the AOL Time Warner merger, but in the essential idea at the heart of it that someday the distinction of old and new media will no longer exist. Borrowing from Winston Churchill, Swisher calls it &#x201c;the end of the beginning&#x201d; of the digital revolution. &#x201c;By that, I mean that it is from the ashes of this bust that the really important companies of the next era will emerge. And that evolution will, I believe, be shaped by what happened&#x2014;and what is happening now&#x2014;at AOL Time Warner.&#x201d;<br><br>To figure it all out, Swisher takes her reader on a journey that begins with a portrait of two wildly different corporate cultures and businesses that somehow came to believe, in the crucible of the red-hot Internet era, that they could successfully join forces and achieve unprecedented growth and success. When the merger was announced in early 2000, the irresistible combination was hailed as the new paradigm and its executives&#x2014;Steve Case, Jerry Levin, Bob Pittman&#x2014;as popular icons of the future. But after the boom so spectacularly turned to bust and the visions of New Media Supremacy lay in ruins, Swisher searches for clues about where the merger went wrong and who is to blame.<br><br>More important, she looks to the future of both AOL Time Warner and the Internet as she seeks to answer the key question that the noise of the disaster has all but drowned out. Will the demise of the AOL Time Warner merger be the final and inevitable chapter of the dot-com debacle or will it herald a new paradigm altogether? This book, then, is a primer for the time to come, using the story of the AOL Time Warner merger as the vehicle to show the troubled journey into the future.</p><p>KARA SWISHER is a technology columnist for the Wall Street Journal and the author of the acclaimed 1998 book on the rise of America Online, AOL.com.

She lives in Washington, D.C.THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH, AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH<br>(or something like it)<br><br>I Made a Little List<br><br>Now, in the frigid and head-clearing morning of the new economy after the New Economy, everyone seems to agree: Time Warner was had by AOL.<br><br>That is, at the turn of the new millennium, the world's biggest and arguably most influential media company merged itself with the highflying online giant and central icon of the Internet boom for a 44 percent stake in the combined company. The problem was AOL's business was soon to crater as that boom turned to bust, and its once lofty stock would become almost worthless. In this simplistic scenario, the trade of the century soon became known as the worst deal in history.<br><br>This is most certainly the tale that has taken up residence in the stony prison of conventional wisdom: A wheezing and increasingly desperate traditional media company, scared of inevitable death (or worse still, irrelevance) in the hot swirl of a digital revolution, marries itself oV to the young, sexy and possibly sleazy starlet of the new-media society.<br><br>Disaster ensues.<br><br>And this merger has most definitely qualified as a disaster of belly flop proportions, by any measure you might care to use, which AOL Time Warner's own magazine, Fortune, dubbed "one of the greatest train wrecks in corporate history." The stock's 75 percent drop within two years of the deal's completion, the vicious purge of the top executives responsible for the merger, the investigations into dicey accounting practices, the poisonous atmosphere-all this has resulted in a constant barrage of ugly news headlines and poor morale at the company.<br><br>As I sit here in 2003 surveying the carnage, it is hard not to feel a bit queasy about the whole sorry mess. I had been following AOL's history-and the course of the whole commercial Web revolution-from early on, so it felt a bit like I was watching someone fall down a flight of stairs in slow motion, and every bump and thump made me wince. It made me reassess old ideas and wonder what I had gotten wrong. And it left me deeply confused as to what had happened and, more important, what was coming next.<br><br>That was certainly how one of the company's largest and most vocal shareholders, Ted Turner, seemed to be feeling, too. Turner, the legendary media entrepreneur who'd gained as much fame for his headline-grabbing antics as for founding CNN, had begun ranting regularly about AOL Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin not long after the January 2000 merger announcement. In meetings, according to many sources, he'd call Levin a "liar and a thief"-when, of course, he wasn't discussing his separation and pending divorce from Hollywood star Jane Fonda, which the couple had revealed just a few days before the merger announcement.<br><br>Things got only worse after Turner had lost $7 billion in stock value by the end of 2002. "I'm poor, but I'm proud," he'd say loudly and often. And he took to showing up at the oYces of various Time Warner executives, where he'd turn his pants pockets inside out and cry out to anyone who would listen: "I was robbed."<br><br>Turner was perplexed. Perplexed at what had happened in the deal, and perplexed at how he'd managed to lose more money in two years than almost anyone in the world had ever possessed. In December 2002, on the fifth anniversary of his $1 billion pledge to the United Nations, he announced to reporters, "I went from no money to a pile of money, just as big as the World Trade Center." Unable to stop himself despite the crassness of the comparison, he went on: "Then-just like the World Trade Center-Poof! It was gone."<br><br>Possibly the most vexing part for Turner-though he never seemed to admit it in all his angry outbursts-was the knowledge that he'd done this to himself. Not only had he voted for the deal as a major stockholder; he'd also declared, without any prompting, that he "did it with as much or more excitement and enthusiasm as I did on that night when I Wrst made love some forty-two years ago." As much, okay. But more? No wonder he was suffering such postcoital pique.<br><br>Turner's transformation-from sex-crazed teen to ranting, grumpy old man-got me thinking about the whole deal. So I made a little list, titled: Questions to Ask Ted Turner, If He Ever Agrees to Talk to Me.<br><br>1.Were you really robbed?<br>2.If not, why are you saying you were?<br>3.What did Gerald Levin lie and cheat about?<br>4.Why did you and Jane Fonda break up?<br>(That last one was just for me personally.)<br><br>This led to another list, titled: Questions to Ask Gerald Levin.<br><br>1.Do you think you robbed Ted Turner?<br>2.If so, where is his $7 billion?<br>3.Are you a liar and a cheat?<br>4.Why do you think he broke up with Jane Fonda?<br><br>I went, to tell the truth, a bit list-crazy, making them for everyone involved-Steve Case, other executives, the investment bankers, the Wall Street analysts, major institutional investors, and on down the line to the smallest schmoo at the companies.<br><br>It seemed like an easy job then. I'd just take my many lists and get some answers. Then I'd be able to explain what had happened-which, even more important, would then go a long way toward explaining what had happened in the whole Internet boom and bust. Yes, this should be easy.<br><br>Or so I thought. But the mood in the business world as I began doing interviews in the fall of 2002 was very ugly, and the AOL-Time Warner deal was being held up as the biggest and stupidest moment in the whole era. What I would soon learn was that this was a story in which everyone was to blame, but no one was at fault. And only a few would go on the record about what happened, although everyone would tell you in detail why someone else screwed up. Worst of all, so heavy is the stench of the fetid merger itself, it's been nearly impossible to determine if the main idea of the merger-the virtuous combination of old and new media to face the inevitable digital future together-was ever a worthy one.<br><br>This was, in short, a bad deal in search of a big scapegoat.<br><br>Nobody Still Knows<br><br>As I started writing this book, the multiplicity of competing agendas and few truly honest players quickly made it hard to sort things out. Soon enough, I felt a bit like a spun top-which was, as it turned out, an oddly familiar feeling. It was the same one I'd had when I first started writing about the Internet years ago.<br><br>"The truth is: Nobody knows" was the opening line of my first book, aol.com: How Steve Case Beat Bill Gates, Nailed the Netheads, and Made Millions in the War for the Web, which chronicled the rise of an unlikely group of entrepreneurs on the edge of disaster to the heights of status, power, and money. The line was meant to show how few people understood the power of this entirely new and highly disruptive online medium. And, more to the point, how fewer still thought America Online, which had been left for dead many times on its rocky journey, could ever amount to much at all.<br><br>That book was a story of the losers winning it all. With crazy characters and huge hype, big-time moguls and risky deals, and piles upon piles of money, the AOL story was a primer on the dot-com revolution that electrified the country at the end of the twentieth century. As the biggest player of them all, AOL sat at the very top of this world when I completed the book in 1997.<br><br>And then, AOL somehow rose even higher, capping its lofty position at the dawn of the new millennium with the announcement that it would buy the world's most important media company, Time Warner, rather than the other way around. The losers now stood ready to transform the combined company into a place that would control much of what Americans read, listened to, and watched, as well as how they communicated.<br><br>Today, it's easy to forget how bullish the world was on the merger news in January of 2000, because the context of that once hopeful and perpetually frenzied time had vanished almost completely by 2003. The Web-will-change-the-world-and-make-us-filthy-rich cheer had morphed rather abruptly into an It-was-all-a-Ponzi-scheme-wasn't-it? shriek. But let us try to remember anyway: When the merger was announced, it was hailed as the new paradigm and few questioned its wisdom. Its key executives-Steve Case, Jerry Levin, Bob Pittman, and, yes, Ted Turner, too-were seen by many as rock star-like icons of the future. The new sages of the business world, they were admired and envied for their immense wealth, power, and seeming ability to influence the future direction of the world. Mere mortals had become accidental gods, as one Wall Street analyst had told me soon after the deal was announced.<br><br>But now the losers are losers once again, having fallen Icarus-like to earth after arrogance and hubris had brought them too close to the sun. The merger of the century is seen as an abject failure. Instead of high fives and dreams of perfect synergy, AOL Time Warner has become a place of vicious boardroom infighting, management coups, shaky morale, and a general feeling that the whole effort to merge the old and new economies has been a farce. There are, of course, lawsuits on top of lawsuits, as the molten anger hardened into a much colder and more urgent need for revenge and retribution.<br><br>As things started to teeter and then topple at the company, I, too, found myself weirdly upset. First of all, there was an element of self-interest in my discomfort. The column I wrote about the tech sector for the Wall Street Journal was called "Boom Town." "Been watching the NASDAQ. Think we should change the name to 'Bust-town'?" Journal managing editor Dan Hertzberg had written me in an email on November 30, 2000, as the Net royalty started to show major signs of wilting. When your boss starts making little "jokes" like that, you know it's time to start looking for answers.<br><br>But it wasn't just that. There was also the dirty little secret I have continued to hold in these antidigital times: I am...</p><h2>Baptist Battles: Social Change and Religious Conflict in the Southern Baptist Convention</h2><p><p>Since 1979 Southern Baptists have been noisily struggling to agree on symbols, beliefs, and practices as they attempt to make sense of their changing social world. Nancy Ammerman has carefully documented their struggle. She tells the story of the Baptist reversal from a moderate to a fundamentalist outlook and speculates on the future of the denomination.</p><p>Ammerman places change among the Southern Baptists in the context of the cultural and economic changes that have transformed the South from its rural past into an urbanizing, culturally diverse region. Not only did the South change; Southern Baptists did as well. Reflecting this diversity, the Southern Baptist bureaucracy was relatively progressive. During the 1960s and 1970s, moderate sentiments prevailed, while fundamentalists remained on the margins. These two were, however, becoming increasingly divergent in what they considered important about being a Baptist, in their views about the Bible, in their attitudes on the origination of women, on Christian morals, and on national politics.</p><p>Late in the 1970s, a fundamentalist coalition emerged, followed by unsuccessful efforts by moderates to oppose it. The battles escalated until 1985, when 45,000 Baptists gathered in Dallas to decide between contending presidential candidates. That dramatic event illustrated the extent to which organized political resources were determining the course of the conflict. Ammerman studies these strategies and resources as well.</p><p>Examining how this tension affected Baptists, Ammerman begins with case studies of the change it is producing in Baptist agencies. But she also brings us back to the local churches and individual believers who are renegotiating their relationships within their denomination. She asks whether the denomination&#x2019;s polity can accommodate an increasingly diverse group of Baptists, of whether the only way dissidents can have a voice is through schism.</p></p><p>This book is a peculiar mixture of sociological curiosity and personal involvement. It is a scientific analysis of a denomination in conflict, and it is indirectly the story of the author&#39;s own religious odyssey. The story told here of consensus moving toward division is also the story of his own journey from unquestioning acceptance to alienation.Nancy Tatom Ammerman is a professor of the sociology of religion at the Hartford Seminary. She is author of several books, including <i>Baptist Battles</i> and <i>Bible Believers</i> (both Rutgers University Press). The research for this book was supported by a grant from the Lilly Endowment.</p><h2>Doom Patrol, Book 4: Musclebound</h2><p>The Doom Patrol must stave off threats to the very structure of existence, including the sinister workings of the Ant Farm and the return of the Brotherhood of Dada.</p><p>Grade 10 Up&#x2014;Morrison is one of the more innovative writers in superhero comics, mixing layers of character and complex concepts with the straight-ahead action for which the genre is known. He assumed the writing for <i>Patrol</i> in the early 1990s, keeping classic characters like Robotman, but quickly making the title his own by adding bizarre figures. Among the latter are a sentient city street and a woman with 64 distinct personalities, each with a unique set of superpowers. <i>Musclebound</i> spans issues 42&#x2013;50 of the original serial and starts when Flex Mentallo, a superstrong hero inspired by Charles Atlas, seeks out the help of the Doom Patrol to battle a dark cabal, known as the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E., hiding under the Pentagon. Later stories include a being that threatens to destroy a small town by bringing its inhabitants' sexual fantasies to life and a team of supervillains called the New New New Brotherhood of Dada, a nonsensical group that fights to rid the world of every piece of logic and rationality. Despite a different artist for each issue, the illustrations have a consistently realistic but sketchy style that gets cartoony when the plot calls for it. <i>Doom Patrol</i> is for older YAs looking for something a little bit different. Part satire and part reinvention of comics, this collection delivers tales that, despite being over a decade old, are still fresh and daring.&#x2014;<i>Matthew L. Moffett, Pohick Regional Library, Burke, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Fans of Morrison's adventurous approach to superheroes in recent DC titles should see his earlier outre treatment of <i>Doom Patrol</i>. He recast a 1960s team of outcast heroes (DC's answer to Marvel's X-Men) as a volatile group of aberrant adventurers. One suffers from -multiple-personality disorder (64 distinct personas, no less, each with its own superpower); other members include an ape-faced adolescent girl who brings imaginary beings to life and a bandaged, radioactive hermaphrodite who contains a being made of negative energy. The sequences gathered here introduce Flex Mentallo, a Charles Atlas-derived bodybuilder whose muscle training imparted strange mental powers. He alerts the Doom Patrol to a menace lurking underneath the Pentagon, where the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E. have based an effort to eliminate all eccentricities and irrationality. Later, the team visits once-quiet Happy Harbor, which has been overwhelmed by a dream transplant that unchains the townspeople's libidos. Mainstream comics have seen their share of experiments in the 15 years since these yarns emerged, but they remain freshly bizarre and impressively audacious. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Clarke. During the week of the initial publication of <i>Against All Enemies</i>, Clarke was featured on <i>60 Minutes</i>, testified before the 9/11 commission, and touched off a raging controversy over how the presidential administration handled the threat of terrorism and the post-9/11 geopolitical landscape. Clarke, a veteran Washington insider who had advised presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush, dissects each man's approach to terrorism but levels the harshest criticism at the latter Bush and his advisors who, Clarke asserts, failed to take terrorism and Al-Qaeda seriously. Clarke details how, in light of mounting intelligence of the danger Al-Qaeda presented, his urgent requests to move terrorism up the list of priorities in the early days of the administration were met with apathy and procrastination and how, after the attacks took place, Bush and key figures such as Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, and Dick Cheney turned their attention almost immediately to Iraq, a nation not involved in the attacks. <i>Against All Enemies</i> takes the reader inside the Beltway beginning with the Reagan administration, who failed to retaliate against the 1982 Beirut bombings, fueling the perception around the world that the United States was vulnerable to such attacks. Terrorism becomes a growing but largely ignored threat under the first President Bush, whom Clarke cites for his failure to eliminate Saddam Hussein, thereby necessitating a continued American presence in Saudi Arabia that further inflamed anti-American sentiment. Clinton, according to Clarke, understood the gravity of the situation and became increasingly obsessed with stopping Al-Qaeda. He had developed workable plans but was hamstrung by political infighting and the sex scandal that led to his impeachment. But Bush and his advisers, Clarke says, didn't get it before 9/11 and they didn't get it after, taking a unilateral approach that seemed destined to lead to more attacks on Americans and American interests around the world. Clarke's inside accounts of what happens in the corridors of power are fascinating and the book, written in a compelling, highly readable style, at times almost seems like a fiction thriller. But the threat of terrorism and the consequences of Bush's approach to it feel very sobering and very real. <i>--John Moe</i>Richard Clarke was appointed by President Clinton as the first National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-terrorism in May 1998 and continued in that position under George W. Bush. Until March 2003 he was a career member of the Senior Executive Service, having begun his federal service in 1973 in the Office of the Secretary of Defence as an analyst on nuclear weapons and European Security issues. In the Reagan administration, Mr Clarke was the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence. In the Bush Administration, he was the Assistant Secretary of State for Politico-Military Affairs. In 1992 Mr Clarke joined the National Security Council staff.</p><h2>The Bravest Worrier</h2><p>Join Zayny on her brave journey defeating the big, hairy, and sometimes scary Worry.

Located one thousand miles from the Alaska mainland and isolated by year-round damp fogs which manage to survive the constant high winds, Attu was called by an early visitor &#x201c;the lonesomest spot this side of hell.&#x201d; <p>In June 1942 Attu and the nearby island of Kiska were invaded by the Japanese in the hopes of accomplishing several goals: forestalling use of the islands by the Americans, hindering U.S.-Soviet cooperation, and establishing bases for attacks on the American mainland. On 11 May 1943, the U.S. effort to retake Attu began. The struggle was essentially an infantry battle. The ever-present fog, rain, and high wind limited the use of air power, and the craggy terrain made mechanized equipment next to useless. The infantry retook the island foot by foot. </p><p>Lieutenant Robert J. Mitchell was one American wounded in the battle.

It is with coal that I make diamonds. What would I not do with a soul, however black she might be, who would give herself to Me. You are the echo of My voice, but if I be silent, what are you then? Most souls do not give their measure of generosity and love because no one asks it of them. It must be asked of them without being exacted; but it must be asked for, asked for on My behalf. When it is asked for Me, souls give; they give even more than is asked of them. It is My joy to help you. I can do great things for eternity with a soul who unreservedly gives herself to Me. To the question . . . Why do You love me, Jesus replied, Your misery attracts Mewhat would you do without Me? I have many souls who love Me and belong to Me. A single one of them can purchase pardon for a great many others who are cold and ungrateful. You must never forget that I always am, and love to be, kind and merciful towards My creatures. Yes, work is a joy and a great dignity for man; but what I desire is no merely your work, but yourself. You dishonor Me when you leave Me to think only of your work. My kingdom is not of this world. That is why I do not seek to make My Royalty resplendent in this world of matter. I dominate matter and merely lend Myself to it. That is why I see, by preference, an appearance of poverty, where matter is very little honored. Thus I am within reach of everyone. Thus you will be able to understand that it is by freeing yourselves from matter that you will discover the world of the Spirit. Give, give, make yourself poor, so that there may be in you and around you only one beauty, your Jesus. These are but a few examples of the wealth of insight into the mind and heart of Our Divine Saviour as contained in these words of love spoken by Our Lord personally to three privileged nuns who lived in the 20th century. Under thirty-four major headings, a monk from the Abbey of the Holy Trinity in Huntsville, Utah has painstakingly compiled this rich selection of gems from the revelations of Jesus to Sister Josefa Menendez (1890-1923), Sister Mary of the Trinity (1901-1942) and Sister Consolata Betrone (1903-1946). There is no reader who will not garner a new and profound understanding about the seemingly mysterious ways of Our Lord toward souls by a thoughtful reading of this unique book.</p><p>W.

Tour.</p><p>Brooks D. Simpson is a professor of History at Arizona State University and the author of Let Us Have Peace: Ulysses S. Grant and The Politics of War and Reconstruction. He resides in Chandler, Arizona.Chapter 1<br>'My Ulysses' Jesse Grant exemplified what America was <br>all about. A man of restless ambition striving to make <br>his own way in the world, he was not shy about sharing <br>his dreams, his hopes, and his accomplishments with <br>anyone who would listen. Behind his drive was an <br>understanding of what it meant to fail. Descended from <br>good colonial stock, Jesse had watched his father, <br>Noah Grant, fall short of the family standard. Noah's <br>claims to military glory as a captain during the <br>American Revolution find no support in existing <br>records; he was overly fond of alcohol and frittered <br>away opportunities and money. He had two sons by a <br>first wife before she died; with his second wife, <br>Rachel, whom he married in 1792, he had seven more <br>children, including Jesse, born in 1794. Ten years <br>later Rachel died in a cabin in Deerfield, Ohio. Noah <br>was unable to hold things together, and before long <br>the family broke up. The two youngest children went <br>with their father to Maysville, Kentucky, where Peter <br>Grant, Noah's son by his first marriage, was operating <br>a tannery. The three middle children were parceled out <br>to other families. Jesse, who was eleven, and his <br>older sister Susan were set loose on their own.<br><br>The boy knew it would take a lot of work to make his <br>way up in the world, but he was dead set on doing just <br>that. For three years he scrambled to stay afloat. At <br>fourteen he gained a job working on the farm of Judge <br>George Tod, a member of the Ohio Supreme Court. He <br>learned something about what might lie ahead for a <br>hardworking lad when he saw the china bowls and silver <br>spoons that the Tods used. Mrs. Tod did what she could <br>to build the boy's ambition and talents, lending him <br>books to read and urging him to find a calling at <br>which he could prosper.<br><br>1<br>Jesse took the advice to heart and at sixteen decided <br>to learn the tanner's trade. He apprenticed with his <br>half-brother Peter, then worked at several tanneries <br>in Ohio, including one owned by Owen Brown, whose son, <br>John, openly denounced the "peculiar institution" of <br>slavery. Jesse agreed with John's sentiments, <br>explaining later that he had left Kentucky because "I <br>would not own slaves and I would not live where there <br>were slaves and not own them." In 1820 he moved to <br>Point Pleasant, on the banks of the Ohio River, some <br>twenty miles upriver from Cincinnati, and commenced <br>working at Thomas Page's tannery in order to <br>accumulate enough capital to open his own business. He <br>also wanted a wife. Page pointed him in the direction <br>of Bantam, ten miles to the north, where John Simpson <br>and his family, migrants from Pennsylvania, had <br>settled on land purchased from Page. Jesse was soon <br>courting Hannah Simpson, "a plain unpretending girl, <br>handsome but not vain," as her suitor remembered in <br>later years. Moreover, she was quiet, allowing the <br>voluble Jesse to hold forth uncontested. Although John <br>Simpson was not too sure about Jesse's prospects, his <br>wife, Sarah, loved to discuss books with the young <br>man; having ingratiated himself with his prospective <br>mother-in-law, Jesse found it easier to achieve his <br>objective of matrimony. As Jesse's savings grew, John <br>Simpson's reservations faded, and on June 24, 1821, <br>Jesse Grant wed Hannah Simpson. The newlyweds returned <br>to Point Pleasant, where Jesse had rented a simple <br>white frame house next to the tannery.<br><br>2<br>When he was not scraping or tanning hides, Jesse Grant <br>spent his hours reading and writing. Always willing to <br>share his opinions with others - and never doubting <br>his own wisdom - he liked to set down his thoughts on <br>politics for the local paper. Hannah quietly kept <br>house, attended the local Methodist church (bringing <br>Jesse with her), and before long discovered that she <br>would soon have new responsibilities. In the early <br>hours of April 27, 1822, she gave birth to a boy, <br>weighing ten and three-quarters pounds, with rich <br>red-brown hair, blue eyes, and fair skin. For nearly a <br>month the newborn went nameless: when Hannah was well <br>enough to travel, Jesse drove his family up to Bantam, <br>where several Simpsons had gathered to help select a <br>name. Hannah wanted to name the boy Albert, after <br>Pennsylvania's Albert Gallatin, who had played a <br>prominent role in Jeffersonian politics as a diplomat <br>and secretary of the treasury. One sister seconded the <br>choice; another preferred Theodore. John Simpson spoke <br>up, offering "Hiram, because it is such a handsome <br>name." When Sarah Simpson, fresh from reading <br>F�nelon's Telemachus and thrilled by its dramatic <br>description of Greek heroes, opted for Ulysses, Jesse, <br>seeing yet another opportunity to please his <br>mother-in-law, endorsed the suggestion (perhaps he had <br>a hand in making it, for he had lent the book to <br>Sarah). Aware of the growing political nature of the <br>discussion, however, and determined to offend no one, <br>he decided to leave the choice to chance. Anne <br>Simpson, Hannah's youngest sister, drew a slip from a <br>hat bearing the name Ulysses. Looking to swing one <br>more deal, Jesse then declared that the boy's name <br>would be Hiram Ulysses - a decision designed to <br>delight both in-laws. Fate eventually triumphed over <br>politics: the boy would always be known as Ulysses - <br>or, as his father would put it, "my Ulysses."<br><br>3<br>By the following year Jesse had accumulated enough <br>money to strike out on his own. He moved his family <br>inland to Georgetown, the county seat, set up his own <br>tannery a block east of the town square, and soon <br>settled with Hannah and their son in a new brick <br>two-story home. The structure was an impressive sight <br>among the log cabins and plaster walls of other <br>residences in the small town known for the propensity <br>of its residents to drink - no surprise in light of <br>the two dozen distilleries in Brown County. No matter, <br>thought Jesse - he was now set up to make a living in <br>an area that provided a ready supply of tanning bark. <br>He befriended the justice of the peace, Thomas L. <br>Hamer, who shared his political preferences for Andrew <br>Jackson and a more democratic polity, and commenced <br>working and writing to make a name for himself. But at <br>times his offspring stole center stage from his <br>father. Just as Ulysses neared his second birthday, a <br>small circus came to town. The toddler, adorned in <br>petticoats, was fascinated by a trained pony; when the <br>ringmaster invited members of the audience to ride the <br>animal, Ulysses begged and implored his father until <br>he got his way. Lifted onto the horse's back and held <br>in place by an adult, he circled the ring several <br>times, "manifesting more glee than he had ever shown <br>before." Several months later, a neighbor with an odd <br>sense of curiosity wanted to see how the child would <br>respond to the noise of a pistol shot. As Jesse held <br>Ulysses, the boy tugged at the trigger. Finally the <br>weapon went off: delighted, Ulysses demanded, "Fick it <br>again! Fick it again!" The next year, however, when <br>the toddler heard the local physician prescribe powder <br>to remedy an ailment, he cried out, "No, no, no! I <br>can't take powder; it will blow me up!" Family members <br>retold the story for years to come.<br><br>4<br>By the time he was three, Ulysses was joined by a <br>brother, Samuel; later came several more brothers and <br>sisters, until by 1839 the Grants had three boys and <br>three girls. Jesse added to the house as he added to <br>the family: he bought books, read newspapers, and <br>continued to make money and broadcast his opinions. As <br>the eldest child, Ulysses got his own room on the <br>second floor - but just about all he could see from <br>his bedroom window was the tannery. He did not enjoy <br>the view. The process of tanning hides as well as the <br>stench that resulted turned his stomach. He hated <br>doing chores. Whenever he could, he preferred to be <br>with living animals, especially horses, for whom he <br>soon developed a passion. As a small boy he liked to <br>go out in the stable and sit beside his four-legged <br>friends. Aware of the damage an errant hoof might <br>cause, a neighbor shared her alarm with Hannah Grant. <br>Calmly, Hannah smiled: "Horses seem to understand <br>Ulysses."<br><br>5<br>And Ulysses seemed to understand horses. He was only <br>five years old when he learned how to stand on the <br>back of a trotting horse, using the reins to keep his <br>balance. At six he harnessed horses to haul brush, <br>much to his father's surprise; when Jesse opened a <br>small livery business, it was Ulysses who often drove <br>passengers or carted wood. At nine he had saved up <br>enough money to buy his first horse; local townsfolk <br>brought him horses to break and train, and marveled as <br>he raced through town or hugged the neck of an <br>uncooperative colt as it bucked, kicked, and reared up <br>on its hind hooves. When a horse had distemper, its <br>owner would bring it to Ulysses to ride, for the best <br>way to cure the ailment was by running the horse at a <br>gallop to burn out the disease. Other boys tried to <br>imitate him, sometimes prodded on by Ulysses, who <br>teased them that their horses were too slow: one <br>unfortunate youth was crushed to death when his mount <br>suddenly shied and fell on him. Although Ulysses's <br>reaction to the boy's death went unrecorded, <br>thereafter he drew closer to the boy's mother, Mrs. <br>Bailey, who lived just up the street. In turn she <br>thought he was "exceedingly kind and amiable."<br><br>6<br>Two stories about the boy and horses suggested <br>something deeper about the character of Jesse Grant's <br>eldest son.<br>Ulysses was eleven when another circus visited <br>Georgetown. Once more the ringmaster brought out a <br>trained pony; once more Ulysses mounted it. This time, <br>however, the ringmaster barked orders for the pony to <br>throw its rider while galloping at full speed around <br>the ring. Ulysses simply dug in his heels. Undeterred, <br>the ringmaster brought out a monkey: it scrambled on <br>board, grabbed Ulysses by the hair, and stared down at <br>the boy's face. People laughed; then they grew <br>astonished when they saw that Ulysses stayed on. There <br>was no quit in this boy. In a similar episode young <br>Grant earned five dollars for hanging on to a <br>particularly slick mount.<br><br>7<br>And yet the boy's love of horses could also lead to <br>embarrassment. He was only eight years old when he set <br>his heart on buying a colt owned by Robert Ralston, a <br>farmer who lived just west of town. Jesse, needing to <br>expand his stable, entrusted his son to make the <br>purchase, but only after instructing him in the fine <br>art of negotiating, for he did not want to pay <br>Ralston's asking price of twenty-five dollars. <br>Accounts differ in the details of what happened next, <br>but all agree that when Ralston asked the boy what his <br>father would pay, Ulysses blurted out, "Papa says I <br>may offer you twenty dollars for the colt, but if you <br>won't take that, I am to offer twenty-two and a half, <br>and if you won't take that, to give you twenty-five." <br>As he later dryly remarked, "It would not require a <br>Connecticut man to guess the price finally agreed <br>upon."<br><br>8<br>This tale soon made the rounds of Georgetown. Fathers <br>and sons alike guffawed and laughed at the business <br>acumen of "my Ulysses"; for once Jesse was forced to <br>listen. Ulysses Grant later recalled that the story <br>"caused me great heart-burning . . . and it was a long <br>time before I heard the last of it."<br><br>Biographers looking to find the man in the boy have <br>read much into the incident. It was an early sign of <br>his naivete in business; it illustrated his <br>determination to gain his objective; it epitomized his <br>guilelessness and gullibility. But Grant put his own <br>stamp on the story. "I certainly showed very plainly <br>that I had come for the colt and meant to have him," <br>he recounted: Jesse's desire to cut a deal would not <br>deter his son from what he wanted. Additional <br>information about the aftermath tended to place the <br>incident in a better light. Nearly four years later, <br>the horse now nearly blind, Ulysses sold him for <br>twenty dollars - not a bad price; two years after <br>that, he spotted the Ralston horse "working on the <br>tread-wheel of the ferry-boat." Nevertheless, he never <br>forgot the teasing: "Boys enjoy the misery of their <br>companions, at least village boys in that day did, and <br>in later life I have found that all adults are not <br>free from the peculiarity."<br><br>9<br>Horses were more honest than people, or so Ulysses <br>seemed to believe, for he gave himself to them as he <br>never did to his friends. He trusted them, and they <br>responded to him. Nor was his compassion limited to <br>horses. He showed little interest in hunting; as for <br>his father's tanning trade, he frankly "detested it," <br>preferring to work his father's fifty-acre farm on the <br>outskirts of town or do anything else involving <br>horses. He hauled and plowed; he transported <br>passengers, sometimes as far as Cincinnati and once to <br>Toledo, some 250 miles away; he often paid other boys <br>to do his work at the tannery, then hired out his <br>services as a horseman to people in the community, <br>pocketing the difference. For fun he fished in the <br>summer and skated in the winter, played ball with the <br>boys, and took the girls on sleigh rides. He enjoyed <br>swimming in White Oak Creek, which ran just west of <br>the town, although once he nearly lost his life when <br>he fell off a log into the creek, then flooded as a <br>result of recent rains, and found himself being <br>dragged away by the current; only the alert actions of <br>his chum, Dan Ammen, rescued him from drowning. At <br>school he was well behaved, usually escaping the <br>schoolmaster's switch; his schoolmates found him <br>quiet, a bit shy, and not particularly studious. "He <br>was a real nice boy," one of the girls later <br>remembered, "who never had anything to say and when he <br>said anything, he always said it short." Another <br>playmate noted that while Ulysses "was up to any lark <br>with us," he "went about everything in such a <br>peculiarly businesslike way. . . . I don't remember <br>that I ever saw him excited." Perhaps he was a quiet <br>boy because as Jesse's son he did not want to call <br>more attention to himself - except when he mounted a <br>horse, when he mixed flair with an occasional <br>willingness to show off. Had it not been for this <br>skill (and the burdens that came with being Jesse <br>Grant's son), Ulysses would have led an unremarkable <br>childhood.<br><br>10<br>By the 1830s Georgetown was well on the way toward <br>shedding its frontier origins. In 1827 a Methodist <br>church opened across the street from the Grant <br>residence; two years later the children started <br>attending school in a newly opened brick building, the <br>successor to the subscription school just a few dozen <br>yards from the Grant house.

Step back into a world of insightful reflection as Proust is brought back, through the legendary magic of the smell of a madeleine, to his youth in a small town of France.</p><p>Adult/High School-In 1998, the first of Heuet's well-researched volumes adapting Proust's novel to graphic-novel format reached publication in France. Now, it is available to American readers, who will be delighted to find that the wait paid off. Johnson's English renderings of the Proustian prose to which Heuet remained faithful in both his dialogue balloons and narrative panels maintain the tone, pacing, and spirit of the original work. The color illustrations use clear line and are well informed by the research into the appearances of Proust's material world of turn-of-the-century France. In this volume, the narrator is a young boy living in the middle-class comfort of his ancient relatives' country home in Combray. The household is rife with secrets, imagined secrets, and self-dramatizing, while the neighborhood includes secrets in the way of M. Swann, the church, an uncle who entertains the wrong sort of female company, and other folks. Heuet's rendition will bring Proust new audiences as well as readers invited back by this visual taste of the fabled madeleine. This is no dumbing down of great literature, but rather a great riff and interpretive play on the original.<p></p><p><i>Francisca Goldsmith, Berkeley Public Library, CA</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>When this, the first in a proposed 12-volume comic-strip version of <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, appeared in France in 1998, the first printing sold out despite scathing reviews. Illustrator Heuet, an advertising executive, calls the project an "effort to democratize Proust," and on that level it can hardly be faulted. Heavily reliant on massive direct extracts from the novel's text, the adaptation is dutiful enough to impart a working knowledge of Proust that obviates actually reading him. It is rather a Classics Illustrated treatment for culture snobs, and its literalness prevents it's being good literature. Furthermore, Heuet's standard Eurocomics draftsmanship, which renders characters with near-iconic simplicity (young Marcel resembles an enervated Tintin) ensures that it isn't good comics, either. A more imaginative visualization of its source, like that of filmmaker Raoul Ruiz in <i>Time Regained</i>, still might have displeased Proust purists, but it might have better exploited the strengths of the comics medium. Still, the audacity of Heuet's effort guarantees it a large audience of curiosity seekers, at least for the first installment. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It shows Campbell&#x2019;s remarkable mind engaged with a favorite topic, the myths and metaphors of Asian religions. Myths of Light collects seven lectures and articles on subjects ranging from the ancient Hindu Vedas to Zen koans, Tantric yoga, and the Tibetan Book of the Dead. A worthy companion to Campbell&#x2019;s Asian journals, this volume conveys complex insights through warm, accessible storytelling, revealing the intricacies and secrets of his subjects with his typical enthusiasm.</p><p>Joseph Campbell is widely credited with bringing mythology to a mass audience. His works, including The Hero with a Thousand Faces, the four-volume The Masks of God, and The Power of Myth (with Bill Moyers), rank among the classics in mythology and literature.In this volume of previously unpublished lectures and articles, the late world folklorist and comparative mythologist Campbell extols the myths of Asian religions, though, as always, the whole of humanity is the author's intended audience. With jaunty, American optimism, Campbell delves into the stories and imagery, as he defines them, of Buddhism and Yoga and other "Oriental" systems of belief, to find a well of deep humanistic wisdom in each one, sharply in contrast to the anti-spiritual habits of the West. "You may have practical ethics and that kind of thing, but there is no spirituality in any aspect of our contemporary Western civilization," Campbell writes, suggesting that Western society "is disintegrating as a result" of the loss of religious myth. Campbell molds his stories into Jungian vessels of mystical awe, finding recurring archetypes and story lines embedded in large swaths of the Asian continent; sometimes a sort of fetishizing awe towards the object of his study creeps in: "When one goes to the Orient, of course, one may be physically shocked by the squalor and misery of the people and the life they're living there. Yet this coordinating principle comes shining through all the poverty in a strangely fascinating way, shining with the radiance of this mythic world." Campbell excels in telling the stories themselves-which feature brahmins and yogis, gods and monsters, as they disguise themselves as charioteers, eat themselves up and spy on mortals-and in his glancing descriptions of traditions foreign to us: Japanese "play language," an exceedingly polite mode of speech, for instance, or Jainism's insistence on quenching "all desire for life." His persistent, unifying interpretations cans sometimes deflate the power of these traditions, but this is nevertheless a solid primer. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Seven Seconds or Less: My Season on the Bench with the Runnin&#39; and Gunnin&#39; Phoenix Suns</h2><p>An award-winning Sports Illustrated writer recounts the championship 2005-2006 season with the popular NBA team, describing their revitalization of team play strategies, the contributions of such figures as Steve Nash and Mike D&#39;Antoni, and the injuries and controversies that challenged their efforts. 60,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Jack Mccallum</b> has been at <i>Sports Illustrated</i> since 1981 and the chief NBA writer since 1985.

Her sensation novel was devoured by readers from the Prince of Wales to Joseph Conrad and continued to fascinate theatre-goers and cinema audiences well into the next century. <br> <br> This edition returns for the first time to the racy, slang-ridden narrative of the first edition, rather than the subsequent stylistically 'improved' versions hitherto reproduced by modern editors.</p><p>The Broadview Literary Texts series is an effort to represent the ever-changing canon of literature in English by bringing together texts long regarded as classics with valuable, though lesser-known literature.<p> Lady Isabel Carlyle, a beautiful and refined young woman, leaves her hard-working but neglectful lawyer-husband and her infant children to elope with an aristocratic suitor. After he deserts her, and she bears their illegitimate child, Lady Isabel disguises herself and takes the position of governess in the household of her husband and his new wife. </p> <p> <em>East Lynne</em> is the archetypal sensation novel, filled with disaster, guilt and repentance. It also documents the growing protest against the rigid roles prescribed for Victorian women. Among the many appendices included are a selection of Victorian medical views on men, women, and sexuality. </p></p><h2>Feel Free: Essays</h2><p><b><b><b><b><b>Winner of the 2018 National Book Critics Circle Award for Criticism&nbsp;</b></b></b><br><br>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book<br><br>From Zadie Smith, one of the most beloved authors of her generation, a new collection of essays </b></b><br><br>Since she burst spectacularly into view with her debut novel almost two decades ago, Zadie Smith has established herself not just as one of the world's preeminent fiction writers, but also a brilliant and singular essayist. She contributes regularly to <i>The New Yorker </i>and the <i>New York Review of Books</i> on a range of subjects, and each piece of hers is a literary event in its own right.<br><br>Arranged into five sections--In the World, In the Audience, In the Gallery, On the Bookshelf, and Feel Free--this new collection poses questions we immediately recognize. What is The Social Network--and Facebook itself--really about? "It's a cruel portrait of us: 500 million sentient people entrapped in the recent careless thoughts of a Harvard sophomore." Why do we love libraries? "Well-run libraries are filled with people because what a good library offers cannot be easily found elsewhere: an indoor public space in which you do not have to buy anything in order to stay." What will we tell our granddaughters about our collective failure to address global warming? "So I might say to her, look: the thing you have to appreciate is that we'd just been through a century of relativism and deconstruction, in which we were informed that most of our fondest-held principles were either uncertain or simple wishful thinking, and in many areas of our lives we had already been asked to accept that nothing is essential and everything changes--and this had taken the fight out of us somewhat."<br><br>Gathering in one place for the first time previously unpublished work, as well as already classic essays, such as, "Joy," and, "Find Your Beach," <i>Feel Free </i>offers a survey of important recent events in culture and politics, as well as Smith's own life. Equally at home in the world of good books and bad politics, Brooklyn-born rappers and the work of Swiss novelists, she is by turns wry, heartfelt, indignant, and incisive--and never any less than perfect company.

In this book, the celebrated writer Mr. Fox can't stop himself from killing off the heroines of his novels, and neither can his wife, Daphne. It's not until Mary, his muse, comes to life and transforms him from author into subject that his story begins to unfold differently.</p><p>Mary challenges Mr. Fox to join her in stories of their own devising; and in different times and places, the two of them seek each other, find each other, thwart each other, and try to stay together, even when the roles they inhabit seem to forbid it. Their adventures twist the fairy tale into nine variations, exploding and teasing conventions of genre and romance, and each iteration explores the fears that come with accepting a lifelong bond. Meanwhile, Daphne becomes convinced that her husband is having an affair, and finds her way into Mary and Mr. Fox's game. And so Mr. Fox is offered a choice: Will it be a life with the girl of his dreams, or a life with an all-too-real woman who delights him more than he cares to admit?</p><p>The extraordinarily gifted Helen Oyeyemi has written a love story like no other. <i>Mr. Fox</i> is a magical book, endlessly inventive, as witty and charming as it is profound in its truths about how we learn to be with one another.</p></p><p><p></p><strong>Ali Smith, Booker Prize&#x2013;nominated, best-selling author of <i>There But For The</i>, and <i>The Accidental</i>, interviews Helen Oyeyemi about <i>Mr. Fox</i></strong><p></p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> What&#x2019;s in a name? Why is Mr. Fox called Mr. Fox?</p> <p><strong>Oyeyemi:</strong> Mr. Fox is called Mr. Fox because I think of him as both wild and urbane; also he&#x2019;s a namesake of the English Bluebeard and an even older mythological lady killer, Reynardine (from the French for fox, Reynard). This book is full of foxes and foxgloves and fox trotting and all things fox. As to why the book itself is called <i>Mr. Fox</i>, that&#x2019;s partly because calling it <i>Mary Foxe</i> seemed like bad luck for Mary--books and films that have a woman&#x2019;s name as their title seem to end up with the woman dead or insane or bereft in some way, and I like Mary too much for that. But also one of my favorite writers, Barbara Comyns, wrote a book about a wily man called <i>Mr. Fox</i> in 1987, and even though I didn&#x2019;t know about it or read it until I&#x2019;d finished writing about my own Mr. Fox, I can&#x2019;t help but think that&#x2019;s got something to do with this business somehow. </p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> Where does this story come from and did it go where you thought it would go? What was the process of writing this one like?</p> <p><strong>Oyeyemi:</strong> This story comes from having read <i>Rebecca</i>, which made me want to have a go at writing a Bluebeard story. Then I started reading (and re-reading) Bluebeard variants, from <i>Jane Eyre</i> to Alice Hoffmann&#x2019;s <i>Blue Diary</i> to the Joseph Jacobs fairy tale &#x201c;Mr. Fox,&#x201d; which features a kind of linguistic battle between Mr. F. and the heroine, Lady Mary, who witnesses a murder he commits and has the guts to tell him all about himself to his face. So then I had two characters, and I was off. </p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> What does it mean to lose the plot? Is story different from plot? If so, how, and do they need each other? And why or why not?</p> <p><strong>Oyeyemi:</strong> I reckon losing the plot means finding the story. The plot gets you from A to B and home again, but the story is the surrounding wilderness that you wander into, and then the bears come, and it&#x2019;s impossible to tell which ones would like to invite you to a picnic and which ones would like to make a picnic of you, because they look exactly the same until you&#x2019;re right up close. So I think you do need plot if you&#x2019;d rather not risk approaching a story&#x2019;s bears, either as a reader or a writer--it depends on what sort of story it is. Some stories don&#x2019;t have very interesting bears. (Maybe you don&#x2019;t agree? Maybe you think all bears of this kind are interesting, or at least, more interesting than the plot path?) </p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> If you, like me, think that books produce books, which books are germinal to this one? And if you don&#x2019;t think that, then where do books come from? </p> <p><strong>Oyeyemi:</strong> Yes, books beget books; I&#x2019;d say they&#x2019;re the leading cause of today&#x2019;s plague of books, and may we never be cured. <i>Rebecca</i> caused this one, and Marina Warner&#x2019;s <i>From the Beast to the Blonde</i>, Anne Sexton&#x2019;s <i>Transformations</i>, Angela Carter&#x2019;s <i>The Magic Toyshop</i>, Gombrowicz&#x2019;s <i>Bacacay</i>, Daniil Kharms&#x2019;s <i>Incidences</i>, Susanna Moore&#x2019;s <i>In the Cut</i>, and Barbara Comyns&#x2019;s <i>The Vet&#x2019;s Daughter</i>, too. </p> <p><strong>Smith:</strong> What was in your pockets when you began this book, and what&#x2019;s in them now that you&#x2019;ve finished it? i.e., what&#x2019;s next? </p> <p><strong>Oyeyemi:</strong> When I started writing <i>Mr. Fox</i>, it was summer, and I was interested in cupcakes and foxes and Mills and Boon books written in the 1930s. Now I&#x2019;m interested in fudge and wolves and self-appointed executioners. </p> <p>Thank you for asking me these questions; they&#x2019;re a delight.</p> <p> (Photo of Helen Oyeyemi � Saneesh Sukumaran) </p> <p> (Photo of Ali Smith �Sarah Wood) </p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> Helen Oyeyemi&#x2019;s <i>Mr. Fox</i> uses a series of interconnected vignettes to capture the love triangle between wry, self-absorbed writer St. John Fox, his wife, Daphne, and his imagined muse, Mary Foxe. As his muse Mary takes form on the page, St. John struggles to maintain his already tenuous marriage. Through different time periods and characters, he writes and rewrites Mary Foxe as an embodiment of unrequited love: the young girl who removes her heart to alleviate heartache; the nanny tasked with caring for a cold, apathetic teenager; the fearful daughter reliving her father&#x2019;s stories of the tragedies that befall rebellious children. Through them all is the shared and often feverish complexity that comes with sustained relationships. Oyeyemi published <i>The Icarus Girl</i> at just 19, so it&#x2019;s no wonder that this, her fourth novel, sets a high literary bar. With clever, tender, and often poignant prose, she captures the magic and heartbreak of the love story. <em>--Heather Dileepan</em><p></p></p><h2>Chef John Folse&#39;s Plantation Celebrations</h2><p>Discover the origin of many of America&#x2019;s premier dishes in this 335-page cookbook.

His daughter prefers this one.Proving that there are some wells that never run dry, DC presents another take on the institution known as the Justice League of America. Scripted with a high emphasis on character development by novelist Meltzer (<i>Identity Crisis</i>), the story has the feeling of a fresh start, even if its climax falls somewhat flat. It starts as Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman are bickering over who should join the JLA, with some hurt feelings to follow. The main arc is an affecting one, following the efforts of the Red Tornado&#x2014;who's starting to get annoyed with having died so many times&#x2014;to get back into his android body, or failing that, a mortal one so that he can be reunited with his beloved Kathy and adopted son. This ties in with scattered skirmishes between a JLA squad and a mob of evil Tornado clones. The series starts off stiffly, piling in a lot of exposition between cutting back to the JLA leaders' membership quarrels and crowding the story with a league of minor characters It's best seen as a competent new kickoff for the series rather than a stand-alone graphic novel. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There are hundreds of them available. But when you get one, what do you do with it? Will it take months or even years to become a good Tarot reader? The answer is that you can learn to give great readings in as little as a week if you get <i>How to Read the Tarot </i>by Sylvia Abraham. <br>All you need to do is memorize 26 keywords and you will be able to give powerful interpretations of all 78 cards! And you won't have to look at a book during the reading. If you have been trying to learn how to read the Tarot, or would like to learn, this book is like a gift from the Gods! <br>The secret is in the use of the keywords. Each of the 22 Major Arcana cards gets such a word. For example, the keyword for the Empress (also known as "Key 3") is "I make." The book shows how you can easily expand on this idea to interpret the card. Each of the four suits also has a keyword or two. Pentacles means "money and health." So if the three of Pentacles comes up you combine the keywords and get "I make money." It's just that easy. <br>The book explains each of the keywords and how they apply to each card. This way you'll see that the system is just the beginning. It lets you expand from the short keywords. Also included is a list of the meanings of common symbols used in the Tarot so you can use them to expand on the interpretation of the cards. <br>Of course, unless you had a structure to put down the cards you wouldn't be able to give a reading. This structure is known as a Tarot spread and the book includes several suggested configurations you can use for any purpose.<br></p><p>Sylvia Abraham is owner of The Cosmic Lantern Bookstore in Long Beach, California, where she has been in business selling metaphysical books and supplies for more than 15 years. &nbsp;She has devoted over 20 years to reading the Tarot and teaching others how to interpret the Tarot.</p><h2>Martin Munkacsi: An Aperture Monograph</h2><p>The great fashion photographer Martin Munkacsi was born in Hungary in 1896, spent the 20s and 30s in Berlin, and immigrated to New York City in 1934. For many years the best paid photographer of his time and a profound influence on photographers like Richard Avedon, his work was out of fashion at the time of his death in 1963. Recently, Munkacsi has emerged from history as one of the most significant talents of the twentieth century, having shaped the beginnings of modern photojournalism, set in motion a previously static medium and combined fact-finding accuracy with a highly formal aesthetic standard. Munkacsi was an outstanding representative of the &#39;Neues Sehen&#39; (New Way of Seeing), certainly photography&#39;s weightiest contribution to advanced art. His fashion and sports photography were both groundbreaking and unmatched. Up until now, however, all this work has been scattered throughout the world, and much of it has been lost, although the Ullstein Archive in Berlin maintains an extensive collection of Munkacsi&#39;s work from Hungary and Germany. Martin Munkacsi gathers and assembles this mid-century master&#39;s images as never before. It contains pictures from each of his artistic phases and several photographs and reports that haven&#39;t been seen since their initial magazine publications. A major collection featuring 318 tritones, it offers a valuable glimpse of photography&#39;s tense, technology-obsessed, glamorous and contradictory beginnings.</p><p>F. C.

Chesterton called <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> "a very melodramatic sort of moonshine." Set in a phantasmagoric London where policemen are poets and anarchists camouflage themselves as, well, anarchists, his 1907 novel offers up one highly colored enigma after another. If that weren't enough, the author also throws in an elephant chase and a hot-air-balloon pursuit in which the pursuers suffer from "the persistent refusal of the balloon to follow the roads, and the still more persistent refusal of the cabmen to follow the balloon." <p> But Chesterton is also concerned with more serious questions of honor and truth (and less serious ones, perhaps, of duels and dualism). Our hero is Gabriel Syme, a policeman who cannot reveal that his fellow poet Lucian Gregory is an anarchist. In Chesterton's agile, antic hands, Syme is the virtual embodiment of paradox: </p><blockquote> He came of a family of cranks, in which all the oldest people had all the newest notions. One of his uncles always walked about without a hat, and another had made an unsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else. His father cultivated art and self-realization; his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene. Hence the child, during his tenderer years, was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of absinthe and cocoa, of both of which he had a healthy dislike.... Being surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy, Gabriel had to revolt into something, so he revolted into the only thing left--sanity. </blockquote> Elected undercover into the Central European Council of anarchists, Syme must avoid discovery <i>and</i> save the world from any bombings in the offing. As Thursday (each anarchist takes the name of a weekday--the only quotidian thing about this fantasia) does his best to undo his new colleagues, the masks multiply. The question then becomes: Do they reveal or conceal? And who, not to mention what, can be believed? As <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> proceeds, it becomes a hilarious numbers game with a more serious undertone--what happens if most members of the council actually turn out to be on the side of right? Chesterton's tour de force is a thriller that is best read slowly, so as to savor his highly anarchic take on anarchy. <i>--Kerry Fried</i>G. K. Chesterton&#39;s surreal masterpiece is a psychological thriller that centers on seven anarchists in turn-of-the-century London who call themselves by the names of the days of the week. Chesterton explores the meanings of their disguised identities in what is a fascinating mystery and, ultimately, a spellbinding allegory. As Jonathan Lethem remarks in his Introduction, The real characters are the ideas. Chesterton&#39;s nutty agenda is really quite simple: to expose moral relativism and parlor nihilism for the devils he believes them to be. This wouldn&#39;t be interesting at all, though, if he didn&#39;t also show such passion for giving the devil his due. He animates the forces of chaos and anarchy with every ounce of imaginative verve and rhetorical force in his body.</p><h2>Dear Mr. Henshaw: A Newbery Award Winner</h2><p><p><strong>Newbery Medal Winner * Teachers&#x2019; Top 100 Books for Children * ALA Notable Children&#x2019;s Book</strong></p><p>Beverly Cleary&#x2019;s timeless Newbery Medal-winning book explores difficult topics like divorce, insecurity, and bullying through the thoughts and emotions of a sixth-grade boy as he writes to his favorite author, Boyd Henshaw. </p><p>After his parents separate, Leigh Botts moves to a new town with his mother. Struggling to make friends and deal with his anger toward his absent father, Leigh loses himself in a class assignment in which he must write to his favorite author. When Mr. Henshaw responds, the two form an unexpected friendship that will change Leigh&#x2019;s life forever. </p><p>From the beloved author of the Henry Huggins, Ramona Quimby, and Ralph S. Mouse series comes an epistolary novel about how to navigate and heal from life&#x2019;s growing pains.</p></p><p>When, in second grade, Leigh writes to an author to tell him how much he "licked" his book, he never suspects that he'll still be writing to him four years later. And he never imagines the kinds of things he'll be writing about: <blockquote> Dear Mr. Henshaw, I am sorry I was rude in my last letter... Maybe I was mad about other things, like Dad forgetting to send this month's support payment. Mom tried to phone him at the trailer park where, as Mom says, he hangs his hat. </blockquote> It's not easy being the new kid in town, with recently divorced parents, no dog anymore, and a lunch that gets stolen every day (all the "good stuff," anyway). Writing letters, first to the real Mr. Henshaw, and then in a diary to a pretend Mr. Henshaw, may be just what he needs.<p> This Newbery Medal-winning book, by the terrifically popular and prolific Beverly Cleary (<i>Ramona Quimby, Age 8</i> and <i>Runaway Ralph</i>), exhibits a subtlety and sensitivity that will be appreciated by any youngster who feels lonely and troubled during the transition into adolescence. Winner of numerous other awards, including two Newbery Honors, Cleary teams up with Caldecott winner Paul O. Zelinsky, who creates a quiet backdrop for the realistic characters. (Ages 8 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p><p><em>Dear Mr. Henshaw,</em></p><p><em>I wish somebody would stop stealing the good stuff out of my lunchbag. I guess I wish a lot of other things, too. I wish someday Dad and Bandit would pull up in front in the rig ... Dad would yell out of the cab, "Come on, Leigh. Hop in and I'll give you a lift to school."</em></p><p>Leigh Botts has been author Boyd Henshaw's number one fan ever since he was in second grade. Now in sixth grade, Leigh lives with his mother and is the new kid at school. He's lonely, troubled by the absence of his father, a cross-country trucker, and angry because a mysterious thief steals from his lunchbag. Then Leigh's teacher assigns a letter-writing project. Naturally Leigh chooses to write to Mr. Henshaw, whose surprising answer changes Leigh's life.</p></p><h2>The Anatomy of Racial Inequality (W.E.B. Du Bois Lectures)</h2><p><p> Speaking wisely and provocatively about the political economy of race, Glenn Loury has become one of our most prominent black intellectuals--and, because of his challenges to the orthodoxies of both left and right, one of the most controversial. A major statement of a position developed over the past decade, this book both epitomizes and explains Loury's understanding of the depressed conditions of so much of black society today--and the origins, consequences, and implications for the future of these conditions. </p><p> Using an economist's approach, Loury describes a vicious cycle of tainted social information that has resulted in a self-replicating pattern of racial stereotypes that rationalize and sustain discrimination. His analysis shows how the restrictions placed on black development by stereotypical and stigmatizing racial thinking deny a whole segment of the population the possibility of self-actualization that American society reveres--something that many contend would be undermined by remedies such as affirmative action. On the contrary, this book persuasively argues that the promise of fairness and individual freedom and dignity will remain unfulfilled without some forms of intervention based on race. </p><p> Brilliant in its account of how racial classifications are created and perpetuated, and how they resonate through the social, psychological, spiritual, and economic life of the nation, this compelling and passionate book gives us a new way of seeing--and, perhaps, seeing beyond--the damning categorization of race in America. </p></p><p><b>Glenn C. Loury</b> is a distinguished economic theorist. His many scholarly articles include contributions to the fields of welfare economics, game theory, industrial organization, natural resource economics, and the economics of income distribution. He is also a prominent social critic and public intellectual.Coolly, clearly, and relentlessly, Glenn Loury traces the devastating effects of racial stigmatization on relations between blacks and whites in America. He uses the analytic tools of economics deftly without for a moment falling into pomp or mystification. No one has better stated the case against presuming that liberal states and free markets will of themselves dissolve unjust inequalities.

Do the images and actions seem bewildering and the meaning confusing? Opening the Seven Seals combines outstanding LDS and biblical scholarship. Richard D.

Some questions he addresses include: � What is apocalyptic literature? � What do the various beasts represent? � What is the significance of numbers and their use? � What are the differences and purposes of the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls? � How does the book testify of Jesus Christ and warn of Satan? � What does the book say about the last days, the Millennium, and the final judgment? Opening the Seven Seals will help the reader find the fulfillment of this promise: &#x201c;Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand&#x201d; (Rev. 1:3).</p><p>Richard D.

And in the introduction to this new edition, Swallow Press executive editor and author Kevin Haworth calls attention to the contemporary feeling of the story&#x2014;despite its having been written more than fifty years ago and set several hundred years in the past. As in Lewis&#x2019;s best-known novel, <i>The Wife of Martin Guerre</i>, the plot derives from Samuel March Phillips&#x2019;s nineteenth-century study, <i>Famous Cases of Circumstantial Evidence,</i> in which this British legal historian considered the trial of Pastor S�ren Qvist to be the most striking case.</p></p><p><p><b>Janet Lewis</b> was a novelist, poet, and short-story writer whose literary career spanned almost the entire twentieth century.

He stayed for ten years, first as a student and later as a correspondent for Time magazine. By the time he left, Karnow knew Paris so intimately that his French colleagues dubbed him "le plus parisien des Am�ricains" --the most Parisian American. Now, Karnow returns to the France of his youth, perceptively and wittily illuminating a time and place like none other.<br><br>Karnow came to France at a time when the French were striving to return to the life they had enjoyed before the devastation of World War II. Yet even during food shortages, political upheavals, and the struggle to come to terms with a world in which France was no longer the mighty power it had been, Paris remained a city of style, passion, and romance. Paris in the Fifties transports us to Latin Quarter caf�s and basement jazz clubs, to unheated apartments and glorious ballrooms. We meet such prominent political figures as Charles de Gaulle and Pierre Mend�s-France, as well as Communist hacks and the demagogic tax rebel Pierre Poujade. We get to know illustrious intellectuals, among them Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, and Andr� Malraux, and visit the glittering salons where aristocrats with exquisite manners mingled with trendy novelists, poets, critics, artists, composers, playwrights, and actors. We meet Christian Dior, who taught Karnow the secrets of haute couture, and Prince Curnonsky, France's leading gourmet, who taught the young reporter to appreciate the complexities of haute cuisine. Karnow takes us to marathon murder trials in musty courtrooms, accompanies a group of tipsy wine connoisseurs on a tour of the Beaujolais vineyards, and recalls the famous automobile race at Le Mans when a catastrophic accident killed more than eighty spectators. Back in Paris, Karnow hung out with visiting celebrities like Ernest Hemingway, Orson Welles, and Audrey Hepburn, and in Paris in the Fifties we meet them too.<br><br>A veteran reporter and historian, Karnow has written a vivid and delightful chronicle of a charmed decade in the greatest city in the world.</p><p>Years before winning the Pulitzer Prize for his definitive history of the Vietnam War, <i>Vietnam: A History</i>, Stanley Karnow lived in Paris as a young reporter. The man who was later to be renowned for his thorough research and crisp prose had to begin somewhere, and Karnow had the incredible good fortune to make his way as a foreign correspondent for <i>Time</i> magazine in the 1950s. His original dispatches to <i>Time</i>'s New York office make up a majority of <i>Paris in the Fifties</i>. <p> By simply calling this collection <i>Paris in the Fifties</i>, however, Karnow has done himself a great injustice. His treatise on the City of Light is more a biography of a city and its culture than it is a mere look at a time and place. Ever wonder where the modern-day restaurant had its origin, or what happened to the French aristocracy after the ravages of the Revolution, or even how the French maintain their status at the forefront of culture--be it food, wine, art, or fashion? Karnow provides the answers and then some. His descriptions are as rich as they are comprehensive, all the while depicting how the French <i>savoir vivre</i>--the zest for life that Paris symbolizes for all of us--withstood the horrors of World War II and the destabilization of society as everyone knew it. This wonderful book is reassurance that no matter what modern threats to culture may come, <i>toujours Paris</i>: we'll always have Paris. And that is true comfort to any expatriate at heart. <i>--Courtenay Kehn</i></p>In July 1947, fresh out of college and long before he would win the Pulitzer Prize and become known as one of America&#39;s finest historians, Stanley Karnow boarded a freighter bound for France, planning to stay for the summer.

Beautifully written." --Sir Ranulph Fiennes<br><br>"As spare, gleaming, and exhilarating as the Arctic wastes and the gentle, stoic Eskimos who had mastery of this realm . . . The book evokes the frozen seas, whale hunts, snow plains and storms that intimidated those rash enough to brave this world, and the traditions, myths, and hunting skills that contoured a bygone way of life . . . His translucent prose is a sparkling and moving record." -- Times (London)<br><br>At sixteen, Edward Beauclerk Maurice impulsively signed up with the Hudson's Bay Company -- the Company of Gentleman Adventurers -- and was sent to an isolated trading post in the Canadian Arctic, where there was no telephone or radio and only one ship arrived each year. But the Inuit people who traded there taught him how to track polar bears, build igloos, and survive expeditions in ferocious winter storms. He learned their language and became so immersed in their culture and way of life that children thought he was Inuit himself. When an epidemic struck, Maurice treated the sick using a simple first aid kit, and after a number of the hunters died, he had to start hunting himself, often with women, who soon began to compete for his affections. The young man who in England had never been alone with a woman other than his mother and sisters had come of age in the Arctic.<br><br>In The Last Gentleman Adventurer Edward Beauclerk Maurice transports the reader to a time and a way of life now lost forever.<br><br>After serving in the New Zealand navy during World War II, Edward Beauclerk Maurice became a bookseller in an English village and rarely traveled again.

Savor it!" -- Edward Hoagland<br><br>"Maurice's memoir supplies a fascinating elegy to a vanishing world." -- Telegraph<br><br>"One of those rare writers who will be remembered for turning out one great memoir/travel book . . . He relates these events in a beautiful prose that is quaintly elegant in tone but never archly so . . . Not only a gentleman but a wonderful writer who limited his output to one book, and perhaps that is why it reads so beautifully." -- Sunday Tribune (Dublin)<br><br>"Maybe he was exceptional, but the charm of his book lies in its modesty; he makes no claims for himself. His concern was to make a record of some amazing adventures and a vanishing way of life; these are woven into an eye-opening narrative that is suffused with kindliness and an attitude to growing up more restrained but more humane than that prevailing today. A gentleman adventurer indeed." -- Times Educational Supplement<br><br>"A deceptively simple account of how he grew to manhood, shaped on one hand by the brutal elements of the Arctic, on the other by the compassionate communities of Inuit who understood them . . . This is a beautifully unadorned, homespun tale with a lack of self-consciousness rare in travel literature . . . I was charmed." -- Benedict Allen, Independent on Sunday</p><p>EDWARD BEAUCLERK MAURICE, after serving in the New Zealand navy during World War II, became a bookseller in an English village and rarely traveled again. He died in 2003, as this book was being readied for publication.Chapter 1<br><br>At ten o'clock in the morning of 2 June 1930 about forty young men gathered <br>round a noticeboard set up on Euston station, which bore the message 'Boat <br>Train, Duchess of Bedford Liverpool. Hudson's Bay Company Party'.<br> The other travellers hurrying to and fro across the concourse, <br>impelled to haste by the alarming pantings, snufflings and whistlings coming <br>from the impatient engines, hardly spared us a glance, despite the flavour of <br>distant adventure in that simple notice. For in those days, London was still <br>the centre of a great empire and it was commonplace for parties to be seen <br>gathering at railway stations, or at other places of departure, to begin their <br>long journeys to far-away places. Tea planters for India and Ceylon. Rubber <br>planters for Malaya. Mining engineers for South Africa. Administrators for the <br>Indian and other civil services. Policemen for the African colonies. Farm <br>workers to seek their fortunes in Australia, New Zealand or Canada. Traders <br>for the South Seas. Servicemen for all quarters of the globe and wanderers <br>just seeking sunshine or adventure.<br> We were to be apprenticed to the fur trade 'somewhere in <br>Canada'. In age we were between sixteen and twenty-three. In occupation <br>there were schoolboys, farm labourers, office workers, factory workers, <br>estate workers, forestry people and even two seamen.<br> We had been told of the wonderful opportunities that awaited us, <br>but what our informants had not known was that the worst depression the <br>world would experience for many years was fast developing. Already the <br>feverish post-war boom was collapsing. The sudden loss of confidence and <br>the general insecurity of the world markets was soon to undermine the fur <br>trade. Before some of us had finally reached our new homes, the whole <br>department responsible for our engagement had been disbanded, with its <br>members released to swell the ever growing ranks of the unemployed. Never <br>again would a party such as ours gather in London.<br> An oriental philosopher once wrote that no matter how near or far <br>the destination, every journey must somewhere have a starting point. My <br>journey began in the June of the halcyon summer of 1913, to which so many <br>thousands of women were to look back with aching nostalgia for all the rest <br>of their years.<br> The shadow fell across my mother's life sooner than it did for the <br>others. Six weeks before I was born, in the evening of a long midsummer's <br>day, my father was brought home spread-eagled over a broken gate, dead of <br>a terrible gunshot wound to the head.<br> Controversy, seemingly inseparable from the human state even in <br>such tragic circumstances, broke out at once. The vicar refused my <br>grandmother's request that her son's body should be brought into the parish <br>church to await burial, on the grounds that he might have committed suicide. <br>The coroner would have to give him earthly clearance from this suspicion <br>before the church could grant him asylum. The clergyman had mistakenly <br>supposed his parishioner, my grandmother, to be a meek and pious woman, <br>an error he was never to repeat. He was astonished by the ferocity with which <br>she defended her son's right to rest in the church, and reluctantly gave way.<br> So my father, poised as it were on the very threshold of eternity, <br>was brought for the last time into the cool, dim, silent shadow of the ancient <br>building, perhaps there to find the peace he had been seeking. The following <br>day the coroner decided that death had been due to misadventure, thus <br>calming the vicar's disquiet and giving at least some hope of an onward <br>journey to heaven. For those that were left on earth, and in particular for my <br>mother, the problems were just beginning.<br> Aged twenty-three, with three children already and a fourth <br>expected, her outlook was bleak indeed, for there was no provision at that <br>time for disasters such as this. No help could be expected from the state, <br>since there was no social security or child allowances. Those who fell by the <br>wayside, whether it was their own fault or not, had to pick themselves up or, <br>as a last desperate measure, appeal to the workhouse guardians for relief.<br> My grandmother then decided she was in need of a housekeeping <br>companion and that her daughter-in-law could fill this position. There would <br>be no pay as such, but food for the young widow and her children would be <br>provided, sparingly as it turned out, and even more sparingly, clothes. <br>Children's garments could be made from oddments, sewn, knitted and <br>handed down. As for my mother, now that she was a widow and would wear <br>black for the rest of her life as Queen Victoria had done, she could inherit the <br>old lady's cast-offs, suitably trimmed to size and shape.<br> This was how my family came to live in a large, cold Victorian <br>house in a small township on the north Somersetshire coast. My mother <br>brought with her all that she possessed in the world. A few items of bedroom <br>furniture. A dressing table and a little jewellery, a few books and a Colt <br>revolver with six rounds of ammunition. What desperate resolve prompted her <br>to bring these last two items I do not know, nor did I ever inquire.<br> The year after our arrival, 1914, the Great War broke out. Perhaps <br>the atmosphere of emergency and the heavy emotional demands made upon <br>most of the young women of her generation helped my mother resign herself, <br>at least temporarily, to living the routine of her elderly mother-in-law.<br> As children we were happy enough, fitting ourselves, as children <br>do, into the circumstances that surrounded us, but mother had to suppress <br>much of her natural jollity, acting as a buffer between her often noisy children <br>at the top of the house and the solemn, easily disturbed downstairs of our <br>grandmother.<br> Grandmother did not believe in the classless society. Indeed, so <br>convinced was she of her own social superiority that there was not one single <br>person in that Somersetshire township who could justifiably be invited to take <br>tea with her. Ranged behind her in defence of her position were several dukes <br>and other aristocrats, closely followed by admirals, generals and the like, <br>some of whom gazed down at us from the walls of the stairways and <br>downstairs rooms. This meant that there was very little social life to enliven <br>the dull days for mother.<br> A room at the top of the house was set aside to be used as a <br>school, and armed with a selection of rather aged textbooks, the young <br>widow began the education of her children, my eldest brother being already <br>over four years old. The knowledge contained in these textbooks was <br>rigorously drummed into our heads, for mother was aware of the necessity of <br>obtaining an education of a higher standard than that offered by the free <br>schools, if one was to prosper, and the only way to do this would be by <br>gaining scholarships or similar awards.<br> One day a visitor called who had heard about a well-known <br>boarding school that had been established with the sole aim of educating <br>suitable children whose parents did not have the available funds. A great <br>number of good people contributed money to the school, and if their <br>contribution was sufficiently large, they were allowed to place an approved <br>child there. I think mother must have written to every single benefactor in <br>order to gain places for her children, and she eventually succeeded in <br>obtaining one for each of us, three boys at the boys' school and our sister at <br>the girls' establishment.<br> The schooling provided was sound, practical and aimed at <br>producing adaptable adults, able to use such common sense as they <br>possessed. Aware of the undoubted benefits of such an education, I would <br>like to be able to record that this was a happy period of my life. Alas, this <br>was not so. From the very start, the school was like some sort of prison. On <br>my second day I quite unwittingly broke some obscure rule, for which the <br>housemaster, no doubt a brilliant mathematician, but lacking in any <br>noticeably human attributes, accorded me a public beating. A suitably sour <br>start to a relationship which was to lack warmth for the next seven years.<br> As time went by, my mother began to think increasingly of <br>escape from the situation which had trapped her for so long. The atmosphere <br>in the old lady's house was not a happy one and my mother longed to go to <br>the other side of the world and start afresh. We had no money, but could <br>work hard and New Zealand sounded like a land of opportunity.<br> My brother blazed the trail by setting off just after the General <br>Strike of 1926, helping to stoke the boilers of an ancient coal burner as it <br>steamed across the Pacific Ocean. He was to work on farms in New <br>Zealand, and two years later my other brother followed him. The three of us <br>who were left at home were to wait until I had finished school, then set off <br>together.<br> As the time loomed near, however, my prospective life as a <br>farmworker lost its appeal for me. We wrote letters to everybody we could <br>think of to see if they could squeeze me in somewhere else, but the reply <br>was always the same &#x2013; too young and no qualifications. Christmas 1929 <br>came and went with the problem no nearer solution, but early in the New <br>Year, a chance happening at school provided a possible answer.<br> A week or two after the start of term, a visitor arrived to take up a <br>long-standing invitation to spend a weekend at the school as a guest of the <br>headmaster. He was the archdeacon in charge of the missionaries working in <br>the Canadian Arctic territories. The news that the clerical visitor was to give a <br>Saturday-night talk was received with some resignation by the boys, but the <br>archdeacon, whose diocese spread from the tree line right away up to the <br>last ...</p><h2>Caught In Crystal</h2><p>Kayl, a widowed innkeeper, finds her past returning to haunt her, when she is asked by the Sisterhood of Stars to take up, once again, her sword to battle an evil force emanating from the Twisted Tower in the Windhome Mountains</p><p></p><h2>All Your Health Questions Answered Naturally</h2><p>1998, 1st oversized paperback edition, MKS Books, Mountain View, CA.

Ann Drayton and Georgette George meet as roommates on the first night. Ann is rich and radical; Georgette is leery and introverted, a child of the very poverty and strife her new friend finds so noble. The two are drawn together by their differences; two years later, after a violent fight, they part ways. When, in 1976, Ann is convicted of killing a New York cop, Georgette comes back to their shared history in search of an explanation. She finds a riddle of a life, shaped by influences more sinister and complex than any of the writ-large sixties movements. She realises, too, how much their early encounter has determined her own path and why, after all this time, as she tells us, 'I have never stopped thinking about her'.</p><p><b>'A brilliant, dazzling, daring novel' <i>Boston Globe</i></b></p><p><b>'A subtle and profoundly moving novel about friendship, romantic idealism and shame' <i>O, The Oprah Magazine</i></b><br><b>'An unflinching examination of justice, race and political idealism that brings to mind Philip Roth's <i>American Pastoral</i> and the tenacious intelligence of Nadine Gordimer' <i>New York Times</i></b></p></p><p></p><h2>Pollen: The Hidden Sexuality of Flowers</h2><p>A captivating glimpse into the unseen world around us, this groundbreaking book is the result of the shared fascination of an artist and a scientist with the perfect design of pollen grains, organisms so small that they cannot be seen without a microscope<br><br>Pollen is ubiquitous: In childhood we all learn a little about plant reproduction and the role of the bee, but few of us are aware of the astonishing diversity of the structure of pollen grains, although these tiny, extraordinary forms have fascinated the scientifically curious since the seventeenth century.

Pollen is ubiquitous; in childhood we all learn a little of plant reproduction and the role of the bee but few people are aware of the astonishing diversity of the structure of pollen grains, although these tiny and extraordinary diversity of the structure of pollen grains, although these tiny and extraordinary forms have fascinated the scientifically curious since the seventeenth century. </p><p> Throughout history there have been polymath geniuses whose passion for understanding enabled them to traverse many disciplines, Leonardo da Vinci being the exemplar. In the seventeenth century came Robert Hooke, chemist, physicist and surveyor of the City of London, whose pioneering development of the compound microscope was to have such an impact on the scientific world. Printed in 1665, his seminal book <i>Micrographia</i> was a landmark in popular science publishing. Not only did Hooke describe in an accessible language his microscopic observations of anything from woven strands of silk to a flea but also he illustrated each specimen with graphic precision, giving the subjects an 'other worldly' appearance. We have become so used to the legacy of richly illustrated books which it engendered, that it is hard to imagine the sensation that <i>Micrographia</i> caused when it was first published. It pre-dated by almost a century the proliferation of popular illustrated books generated to satisfy the growing fascination across Europe for collecting and displaying 'nature's ornaments', with titles such as <i>Spectakulum Naturae &amp; Artium</i>, 1765, and <i>Amusemens Microscopiques</i>, 1776. The relationship between art and science has ebbed and flowed since Hooke's time, Goethe, who would send himself to sleep at night by visualizing the developmental cycle of plants, had a less happy time. He was surprised and dismayed to find that his essay,<i> On the Metamorphosis of Plants</i>, although recognized thirty years later as a serious contribution to botany, was ignored at the time by botanists and public alike. He complained, "Nowhere would anyone grant that science and poetry can be united. People forget that science had developed from poetry and the failed to take into consideration that a swing of the pendulum might benificently (sic) reunite the two, at a higher level and to mutual advantage." </p><p> After a period of separation, the cultures of science and art are currently enjoying a collaborative renaissance. This book is a testament to this new spirit of co-operation. The sophistication and quality of the images produced scientifically is such that they have a clarity and detail that may call into question the need for any artistic intervention at all. However, this would be to ignore the role of the artist in interpreting and translating new scientific imagery, acting as the conduit through which the cultural consequences of scientific discovery are developed. Contemporary audiences of all ages are showing a growing appetite for images of the natural world that not only evoke a sense of awe through their sheer magnificence but also offer the opportunity to learn more about the workings of life. </p><p> It is with great pleasure that we are now able to share the fruits of our science-art collaboration. </p></p><h2>Familiar Birds of North America, Western Region (The Audubon Society Pocket Guides)</h2><p><b>Discover the birds of North America&#x2019;s western region in this compact, beautifully designed, and easy-to-use pocket guide, which includes 80 stunning full-color photos,&nbsp;illustrated accounts and appendices.<br></b><br> Whether your home is in a remote countryside or in a populous city, you will derive hours of pleasure observing and learning about birds, and the <i>National Audubon Society Pocket Guide to Familiar Birds of North America: West</i> is an excellent and convenient reference guide to accompany any bird-lover.</p><p>-use pocket guide includes 80 full-color photos, each showing one of the 80 species you are most likely to come across in North America.

A soldier, explorer, ethnographer, and polyglot of rare power, as well as a poet, travel writer, and translator of the tales of the Arabian Nights and the Kama Sutra, Burton exercised his abundant talents in a diverse array of endeavors. Though best remembered as an adventurer who entered Mecca in disguise and sought the source of the White Nile, Burton traveled so widely, wrote so prolifically, and contributed so forcefully to his generation's most contentious debates that he provides us with a singularly panoramic perspective on the world of the Victorians. </p><p> One of the great challenges confronting the British in the nineteenth century was to make sense of the multiplicity of peoples and cultures they encountered in their imperial march around the globe. Burton played an important role in this mission. Drawing on his wide-ranging experiences in other lands and intense curiosity about their inhabitants, he conducted an intellectually ambitious, highly provocative inquiry into racial, religious, and sexual differences that exposed his own society's norms to scrutiny. </p><p> Dane Kennedy offers a fresh and compelling examination of Burton and his contribution to the widening world of the Victorians. He advances the view that the Victorians' efforts to attach meaning to the differences they observed among other peoples had a profound influence on their own sense of self, destabilizing identities and reshaping consciousness. Engagingly written and vigorously argued, <i>The Highly Civilized Man</i> is an important contribution to our understanding of a remarkable man and a crucial era. </p></p><p><b>Dane Kennedy</b> is the Elmer Louis Kayser Professor of History and International Affairs at The George Washington University.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/KENHIC_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Harry Potter Collector&#39;s Value Guide</h2><p>Lists prices and values of Harry Potter merchandise and collectibles, including figurines, international books, clothing, and forthcoming items.</p><p></p><h2>The Yew Tree: A Thousand Whispers : Biography of a Species</h2><p>Book by Hartzell, Hal, Rust, Jerry</p><p>The story of the yew tree is hundreds if not thousands of years old. Who doesn't recall Robin Hood and his "bow of yew"? In several fascinating chapters, Hartzell traces the tree's history and mythology and then describes the ancient yew trees that survive in English churchyards, probably because the churches were built on pagan sites sacred to the yew tree. He also discusses the dilemma concerning the yew tree of the Pacific Northwest. Once used by Native Americans to make tools and artifacts and as a medical cure-all, it now faces extinction because its bark contains a powerful anti-cancer drug, taxol. The story of environmentalists versus industry is disturbing, but common; what is fascinating about this book is the history of the tree itself. Highly recommended as an addition to natural history or environmental collections. A video on the taxol controversy, The Yew-Tree &amp; Cancer: A Modern Dilemma , is available from the publisher for $24.95.--Ed.<br><i>- Eleanor Maass, Maass Assocs., New Milford, Pa.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Hobbit</h2><p>Bilbo Baggins enjoys a quiet and contented life, with no desire to travel far from the comforts of home; then one day the wizard Gandalf and a band of dwarves arrive unexpectedly and enlist his services - as a burglar - on a dangerous expedition to raid the treasure-hoard of Smaug the dragon.

His father was a railroad man and not inclined to draw out the introspective boy. However, his stepmother, descended from the Mapuche people, was gentle and nurturing and told him stories of Chile's native people. But in her husband's presence, she was as silent as Pablo. So the child found refuge in nature and in books. And secretly he wrote down his thoughts. With the encouragement of Gabriela Mistral, an award-winning poet, teacher, and friend, Neruda's writing grew resonant and powerful. At age sixteen he left Temuco for the university in Santiago and went on to become the "people's poet" and to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. <br>&nbsp;<br>Blending her telling of Neruda's childhood with excerpts from his own poetry and prose, Ms. Ray captures the people and places that inspired him in her rich watercolor illustrations.</p><p>DEBORAH KOGAN RAY is the author and illustrator of several acclaimed children's books, including <i>The Flower Hunter: William Bartram, America's First Naturalist</i>, an NSTA-CBC Outstanding Science Trade Book for Children.

She focuses primarily on two influential women: his stepmother who, raising him from infancy after his mother's death, was&#x2013;in his own words&#x2013;the guardian angel of his childhood, and Gabriela Mistral, principal of the girls' division of his school and a noted poet in her own right. The former introduced him to his Chilean heritage, telling him stories of the indigenous peoples and instilling in him a love of the rain forest. The latter recognized his talent and introduced him to the art of poetry, in which he found his true voice. Ray's realistic craypas and charcoal illustrations beautifully bring his world to life. From the varied monochromatic hues of the lush rain forest to the brilliant colors of the Chilean marketplace, the evocative art captures both the activity of the developing town and the tranquility of nature. The story concludes with an English and Spanish transcription of Neruda's poem about how poetry captured his soul. An author's note, biographical sketches of Neruda and Mistral, and a chronology help to frame the story. An excellent introduction to the human face of poetry.<i>&#x2013;Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

M. Molotov. Lenin and Stalin left no memoirs; now we have <i>Molotov Remembers</i>. These memoirs, in the form of conversations with the poet-biographer Felix Chuev over seventeen years before Molotov's death in 1986, offer an incomparable view of the politics of Soviet society and the nature of Kremlin leadership under communism. Beginning with his early revolutionary activities, Molotov recounts his comradeship with Lenin, the Bolshevik seizure of power, and the perilous years of Soviet rule. First at Lenin's then at Stalin's right hand, premier and then foreign minister, he offers startling insights into the New Economic Policy; the collectivization of peasant farms and the liquidation of the kulaks; the repression of "counterrevolutionaries" in the late 1930s; the making of the Nazi-Soviet pact; World War II diplomacy with the Allies; the Soviet takeover of Eastern Europe; and the rise and fall of Khrushchev. His portraits of an indomitable Lenin; a crafty, brutal, and ultimately paranoiac Stalin; and a host of other Soviet leaders are indelibly drawn from firsthand experience. <i>Molotov Remembers</i> is not only a major publishing event but a historical source of the highest order, throwing fight on the politics and psychology of the most influential episode of the twentieth century.</p><p>Felix Chuev, a poet and biographer, lives in Moscow.

The Tavern at the Ferry does more than set the scene; it chronicles the dramatic story of the events leading up to Washington&#39;s crossing of the Delaware and the ensuing Battle of Trenton, a turning point in the War of Independence. The weeks and days before the crossing were full of intrigue, and Tunis follows the stories of such men as John Honeywell, the patriot double-agent, and Moses Doan, the would-be betrayer, as well as those of the tired but determined troops who turned the tide of war under Washington&#39;s leadership.</p><p><p><b>Edwin Tunis </b> (1897&#x2013;1973) was born in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, and spent much of his life in Maryland.

Larry worked as first mate on a 140-ton, 85-foot schooner, Double Eagle, voyaging from Newport Beach, California, to Hawaii and back and along the Mexican coast before meeting Lin. He, along with Leslie Dyball, won the handicap prize for first overall in the exceptionally stormy 1974 Round Britain two-handed race. Lin and Larry have delivered two dozen boats across oceans and raced their own and others boats. Their interest in storm tactics has led them to research both older and modern methods of heaving-to, by talking and corresponding with sailors from dozens of countries, by working with Victor Shane at the Drag Device Data Base, and by testing both on their own boat in hurricane-force winds and on modern boats off the Cape of Storms, in South Africa. <p>Larry was selected as the winner of the International Oceanic Award, givenby the Royal Institute of Navigation under the sponsorship of the Little Ship Club of London and presented by Her Royal Highness, the Princess Royal, Princess Anne, for the most meritorious voyage of over 2,000 miles using traditional methods of navigation. Larrys award was for 30 years of successful voyaging, covering more than 150,000 miles on 21 different vessels and using onlysextant and chronometer, including his 2,840 mile voyage in 1995 from Fernancdo do Noronha to Horta, in the Azores. </p><p>In March 1996, Lin was presented with the Ocean Cruising Club Award for the person who has done the most to foster and encourage ocean cruising in small craft and the practice of seamanship and navigation in all branches, at the Royal Thames Yacht Club, in London. </p><p>Articles by Lin and Larry have appeared in Sail Magazine, Cruising World, Woodenboat (USA) Practical Boat Owner, Yachting Monthly, Classic Boat Magazine (UK), Cruising Helmsman (Australia), South African Yachting, and Nautica (Brazil). </p><p>Their nine books have been published in both the United States and England; two have been translated into German and Japanese.

After both west-to-east and east-to-west circumnavigations, and voyages to more than 75 countries, they have a breadth of knowledge that few other boating authors possess. Most of their voyaging has been done on an earn-as-you-go budget that could be well within the reach of the majority of those whose dream is to set sail.<p> Their motto? Go small, go simple, but go now! The Pardeys strengths are neatly symbolized by the boats they have built. Each one is romantically traditional, with swooping sheerlines, and is completely dependent on the wind. And yet each boat carries the best, strongest, and most seamanlike gear. Like their vessels, the Pardeys writings are founded on a marriage of the spirit of romantic adventure and the practical, up-to-date seamanship that keeps them and their boats safe.</p><p>Details - Larry Born 1939, Victoria, Canada.

Eight years later, he became one of the fifty-six men to sign the Declaration of Independence, severing America forever from its mother country. Rush was not alone in his radical decision many of those casting their votes in favor of independence did so with a combination of fear, reluctance, and even sadness.<br> In <i>Our Lives, Our Fortunes and Our Sacred Honor</i>, acclaimed historian Richard R. Beeman examines the grueling twenty-two-month period between the meeting of the Continental Congress on September 5, 1774 and the audacious decision for independence in July of 1776. As late as 1774, American independence was hardly inevitable indeed, most Americans found it neither desirable nor likely. When delegates from the thirteen colonies gathered in September, they were, in the words of John Adams, a gathering of strangers.&#x201d; Yet over the next two years, military, political, and diplomatic events catalyzed a change of unprecedented magnitude: the colonists' rejection of their British identities in favor of American ones. In arresting detail, Beeman brings to life a cast of characters, including the relentless and passionate John Adams, Adams' much-misunderstood foil John Dickinson, the fiery political activist Samuel Adams, and the relative political neophyte Thomas Jefferson, and with profound insight reveals their path from subjects of England to citizens of a new nation.<br> A vibrant narrative, <i>Our Lives, Our Fortunes and Our Sacred Honor</i> tells the remarkable story of how the delegates to the Continental Congress, through courage and compromise, came to dedicate themselves to the forging of American independence.<br></p><p><b>Richard R. Beeman</b> is the John Welsh Centennial Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania.

He lives in Media, Pennsylvania.<br>Beeman's prose captures those tensions and facilitates the imagination so the reader can feel a part of the debate.... <i>Our Lives, Our Fortunes and Our Sacred Honor</i> is an appropriate complement to David Stewart's <i>The Summer of 1787</i>.... Beeman has produced an authoritative account of how this nation was imagined, and how the members from different sections of the continent were able to put aside their differences and to explore their differing philosophical, political and market needs to form an embryonic government that has grown to be a beacon for other communities seeking self-governance.&#x201d;<br><i><b> Roanoke Times</b></i><br><br> An engaging history of the Founders of 1776.&#x201d;<br><i><b> Booklist</b></i><br><br> Full of fascinating details.&#x201d;<br><i><b> Publishers Weekly</b></i><br><br> Lively study of the main players of the two Continental Congresses....

Case in point: Richard Beeman's latest book, <i>Our Lives, Our Fortunes, &amp; Our Sacred Honor: The Forging of American Independence, 1774-1776</i>. It's a charming, fast-paced retelling of a narrative that's been retold a thousand times before.... It's not really the historian's trade he's plying in these pages but rather the epic poet's: reciting the grand old stories while the wine of patriot season flows and the night sky over Boston is filled with fireworks.<br>There's a worth to that, and Beeman has written a worthy book.&#x201d;<br><i><b> Open Letters Monthly</b></i><br><br> This book should be required reading in every college survey course on American History...

That&#x2019;s because Bertie is, well, about the size of a watch. So when a horrible robber breaks in, tiny Bertie is put to the test! Bertie nips the robber on the leg, chases him around the sofa, and challenges him to a barking contest. But will Bertie succeed in scaring the robber away? <br><br>Here&#x2019;s a silly story brimming with kid appeal, complete with slapstick chases, comically mismatched adversaries, and a well-deserved triumph by an indefatigable underdog. Combining the fun of comics and a full-size picture book, here is a refreshing new format offering a punch line on every page.</p><p>Rick Walton is the author of numerous books for children, including HOW MANY, HOW MANY, HOW MANY, illustrated by Cynthia Jabar; and two books in Candlewick&#x2019;s Really, Really Bad Jokes series. About BERTIE WAS A WATCHDOG he says, "I like stories where things are not as they seem. A watchdog is usually big and mean. I thought it would be fun to write a story about a watchdog who you discover is not big and mean - who protects not with his bark and his bite, but with his brain."<br><br>Arthur Robins has illustrated such books as WHAT USE IS A MOOSE? by Martin Waddell and has also displayed his inimitable humor in the Giggle Club title THE TEENY TINY WOMAN. Arthur Robins says that his biggest challenge in illustrating Bertie Was a Watchdog was to come up with the right-sized dog. As he explains, "My editor said, &#x2018;Draw Bertie smaller. No, smaller - smaller than that. Smaller still. . . . Good, now, where is he?&#x2019;"When first seen against a receding cityscape, Bertie the watchdog appears to possess all the looming menace of a modern-day Cerberus. But as Walton (Bunny Day) dryly explains, Bertie was called a watchdog because he was about the size of a watch. Robins (The Teeny Tiny Woman) cheekily reveals that when Bertie is rendered from a less distorted perspective, he's not even pint-sized. What chance does a diminutive dog have against a giant intruder? But when a burly burglar invades his territory, Bertie challenges him to a test of wits. In Robins's gleefully garish, full-bleed watercolor-and-ink cartoons, the robber takes up most of the succeeding spreads even his sausage-like nose is bigger than Bertie. But the canine prevails by conning the ne'er-do-well into a series of contests, the last of which determines who can bark the loudest. The robber's winning ruckus captures the attention of a couple of cops on a fast-food break. I win! is the parting riposte of the triumphant Bertie, now the proud owner of an oversize hero's medal. Youngsters will be won over as well both by the pooch's brainy pluck and the reassuring moral that right can triumph over might.

Many of Ms. Uchida's writings are inspired by her Japanese-American heritage. During World War II, she and her family were forced to live in West Coast internment camps. It is in this experience that <i>The Bracelet</i> is based.The haunting immediacy of this moving tale may derive from its roots in Uchida's ( A Jar of Dreams ; The Best Bad Thing ) own childhood experiences--the author was interned in camps for Japanese Americans during WW II. Originally published as a short story, the book opens as Emi, her mother and sister prepare to leave their California home for a new residence: a racetrack that has been turned into a prison camp. Emi's best friend brings her a bracelet as a parting gift. Though Emi vows she will never take it off, the gold chain slips off her wrist as the girl helps clean out the filthy, abandoned stable that will serve as the family's "apartment." After searching for it in vain, Emi eventually realizes that she does not need the bracelet to remember her friend, just as she does not need a photo to remember her father (who has been sent to a prisoner-of-war camp because he worked for a Japanese company); in her mother's words, such important parts of our lives "we carry in our hearts and take with us no matter where we are sent." Yardley's ( The Red Ball ) hushed, realistic paintings add to the poignancy of Uchida's narrative, and help to underscore the absurdity and injustice suffered by Japanese American families such as Emi's.

She spent eight years researching and writing Pre-Raphaelites in Love, her first book. During that time she traveled widely to study the paintings and read thousands of letters written by the artists, their wives, and their families, friends, and enemies. Gay Daly lives in Pelham Manor, New York, with her husband, Jay Lovinger, and their daughters, Woo and Wendy.Behind the dreamlike women in Pre-Raphaelite paintings stood the artists' flesh-and-blood models with whom they often became romantically involved. Dante Gabriel Rossetti transformed shopkeeper Elizabeth Siddal into his saintly Beatrice and slept with barmaid Annie Miller. By marrying teenaged Jane Burden, William Morris tried to seize hold of one of the medieval maidens in his paintings; he projected grace, charm, uncanny wisdom onto her shyness, but she felt emotionally trapped and the marriage broke down. Daly, who has taught women's studies, presents an often touching, sometimes hilarious, always engrossing portrait of the high-minded Victorian Brotherhood, their romances and their almost incestuous cross-connections. The men do not come off well: William Holman Hunt's arrogant attempt to remake flirtatious Annie Miller into a well-read lady reminds one of the Pygmalion-Galatea myth. John Ruskin trivialized and condescended to his wife Effie Gray; she later married sexually demanding John Everett Millais, who made her a breeder in an endless round of pregnancies. This is amorous biography at its witty, perceptive best.

Written with infectious zest, this book tells the story of an historic career, from pre-1914 days when Beatrice studied in Germany and, much to the Kaiser's disgust, carried off the coveted Mendelssohn Prize at the age of 17, to the Second World War. <br><br>In 1924, Harrison became world famous with a BBC broadcast, from her Surrey garden, of a nightingale accompanying her cello - the first of many live broadcasts that sent the public wild with enthusiasm. <br><br>Beatrice Harrison gives vivid glimpses of the musical life of her time, in which she shared with three exceptionally gifted sisters. She tells of her adventures touring in the early years of the century in Europe, Russia and America, meeting such figures as Faure, Popper, Glazunov, Paderewski and Kodaly. She associated with many of the important composers of one of the richest era of English music. Delius wrote his Double Concerto for Beatrice and her sister, May, after hearing them play.</p><p></p><h2>Pastoralia</h2><p>&#39;Saunders is an astoundingly tuned voice - graceful, dark, authentic and funny - telling just the kind of stories we need to get us through these times&#39; Thomas Pynchon In PASTORALIA elements of contemporary life are twisted, merged and amplified into a slightly skewed version of modern America. A couple live and work in a caveman theme-park, where speaking is an instantly punishable offence. A born loser attends a self-help seminar where he is encouraged to rid himself of all the people who are &#39;crapping in your oatmeal&#39;. And a male exotic dancer and his family are terrorised by their decomposing aunt who visits them with a solemn message from beyond the grave. With an uncanny combination of deadpan naturalism and uproarious humour, George Saunders creates a world that is both indelibly original and yet hauntingly familiar</p><p>In both his acclaimed debut, <i>CivilWarLand in Bad Decline</i>, and his second collection, <i>Pastoralia</i>, George Saunders imagines a near future where capitalism has run amok. Consumption and the service economy rule the earth. The Haves are grotesque beings, mutilated by their crass desires and impossible wealth. The Have Nots are no less crippled, both emotionally and physically, by their inferior status. It's a kind of Westworld scenario, but instead of robots, the serving wenches, bellboys, and extras are real people, all of them mercilessly indentured by the free market.<p>Sounds like bleak stuff, doesn't it? Yet Saunders handles his characters with grace and humour In the title story, for example, a couple occupies a squalid corner of a human zoo, where they act out a parody of caveman times, communicating in grunts and hand motions speaking is instantly punishable by the Orwellian management) and conducting their lives during 15-minute smoke breaks. In "Winky", a born loser (really, all of Saunders's characters are born losers) visits a self-help seminar, where he's encouraged to rid himself of all those people who are "crapping in your oatmeal". Exhilarated at the prospect of dumping his simple, crazy-haired, religion-besotted sister, he returns home to the bleak discovery that he needs her as much as she needs him. The protagonist of "Sea Oak" works as a stripper in an aviation-themed restaurant and lives next to a crack house with his unemployed sisters, their babies, and a sweet old maid of an aunt. The aunt dies, and then returns from the grave--not so sweet, now, and still decomposing--with strange powers and a sobering message:</p><p>"You ever been in the grave? It sucks so bad! You regret all the things you never did. You little bitches are going to have a very bad time in the grave unless you get on the stick, believe me!"</p><p>The characters and situations in the rest of <i>Pastoralia</i> are equally wretched. But Saunders rescues them from utter despair with a loving belief in the triumph of the human spirit: yes, things can always get worse, but worse is better than the cold dirt of the grave. And in the small space between wretchedness and death there is plenty of room for laughter, and even love. --<i>Tod Nelson</i></p>George Saunders is one of the very best authors of fiction now writing -- <i>TLS</i><br><br>It's like Monty Python mixed with some John Waters with some Jerry Springer thrown in for good measure. -- <i>QX International</i><br><br>Like a literary take on American Beauty -- <i>Select</i><br><br>This is a formidably assured exercise in black comedy -- <i>Literary Review</i><br><br>This stuff is gold dust... fiercely inventive, unforgettably funny and sentimental in all the right places -- <i>Independent on Sunday</i></p><h2>50 Paths to Creative Photography: Style &amp; Technique</h2><p><br>In keeping with the best tradition of Freeman's writing, this isn't a technical manual looking at camera settings, but a volume which will encourage you to explore what makes great photograhy.<br><br>In Freeman's own words: "There's a long line of opinion, from Plato through Kant, that holds creativity to be unteachable, and to be the province of genius. You have it or you don't. End of story. I don't agree"<br><br>By looking at the work of other great photographers, as well as Freeman's own work, the book provides the reader with 50 "paths" they can explore to think about taking photos, looking at subjects from clich� to zen, so you will be able to hit the right point in surprise, originality, insight and execution every time.</p><p>Michael Freeman, professional photographer and best-selling author, was born in England in 1945, took a Masters in Geography at Brasenose College, Oxford University, and then worked in advertising in London for six years. In 1971 he made the life-changing decision to travel up the Amazon with two secondhand cameras, and when Time-Life used many of the pictures he came back with, he embarked on a full-time photographic career.<br><br>Since then, working for clients that include all the world's major magazines, most notably the Smithsonian Magazine (for which he has shot more than 40 stories over 30 years), Freeman's reputation as one of the world's leading reportage photographershas been consolidated. Of his many books, which have sold over 4 million copies worldwide, more than 60 titles are on the practice of photography. For this photographic educational work he was awarded the Prix Louis Philippe Clerc by the French Ministry of Culture.<br><br>Freeman's books on photography have been translated into 27 languages.<br><br>This is a really inspiring book -- Amateur Photographer * Amateur Photographer *</p><h2>Moose: Behavior, Ecology, Conservation</h2><p>Describes the personality traits, diets, breeding behavior, and social structure of moose, and covers such issues as conservation efforts and their interaction with humans.</p><p>The moose, the largest living member of the family that includes deer and elk, is the beneficiary of a rare change of environmental fortune that has worked out to nature's advantage. Thanks to careful conservation policies, the moose has expanded its range significantly in the last century, growing in numbers and spreading beyond its native range throughout subarctic North America and Eurasia to new homes in the southern Rocky Mountains and southern Scandinavia.<p> Russian-born scientist Valerius Geist, a longtime contributor to <i>National Geographic</i> and other popular publications, here offers a highly readable, affectionate, and entertaining natural history of the moose. In text accompanied by Michael Francis's color photographs, Geist explains why moose are small in some places and large in others (the more mature the plant environment in which it lives, the smaller the moose); discusses migratory patterns, mating habits, social organization, and other aspects of ecology; and honors the moose's highly developed intelligence ("moose," he writes, "are programmed for learning"). With continued conservation efforts and continued goodwill on the part of humans, Geist foresees a healthy future for the moose, even in the face of global climate change that threatens the creature's favored habitats. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Outstanding color photographs by noted wildlife photographer Francis eloquently tell the story of the moose in its natural setting. Accompanying the photographic essay is authoritative text by Geist, a zoologist who has served as a consultant to the National Geographic Society on similar books and television specials. Geist introduces the reader to the natural history of the moose, discussing the different species of moose, social structure, diet, personality, breeding, habitat, and interaction with humans. The book will appeal to wildlife enthusiasts and to those seeking factual information about the moose. It should be equally appreciated for its aesthetic value and for its informational content.

In a fond, frequently hilarious recollection of his Depression-era childhood, the author introduces a cast of characters whose recipes are found in the volume's second half. His tough-as-nails mother ("just scrape off the burnt part"), his sister (and coauthor, referred to as The Troll) and childhood friend Vern Schulz, among others, get a chance to shine. An avid outdoorsman and hunter, McManus has gathered plenty of ideas for cooking up grouse, wild turkey, pheasant and freshly caught fish; there are eight recipes for elk, a couple for bear and 16 for venison, including salami and sausage. A chapter on breads includes interesting sourdough variations, while the vegetable section goes heavy on cabbage (fried, creamed or stuffed) and canned beans. Oddities include kippered cherries, huckleberry liqueur and corncob jelly. Preparation of food is, blessedly, subject to neither humor nor confusion.

History turns on a dime. A missed meeting, a different choice of words, and the outcome changes dramatically. Nowhere is this truer than in the field where Jeff Greenfield has spent most of his working life, American politics, and in three dramatic narratives based on memoirs, histories, oral histories, fresh reporting with journalists and key participants, and Greenfield&#39;s own knowledge of the principal players, he shows just how extraordinary those changes would have been. These things are true: In December 1960, a suicide bomber paused fatefully when he saw the young president-elect&#39;s wife and daughter come to the door to wave goodbye...In June 1968, RFK declared victory in California, and then instead of talking to people in another ballroom, as intended, was hustled off through the kitchen...In October 1976, President Gerald</p><p>Jeff Greenfield is the CBS News senior political correspondent, and a veteran of CNN and ABC News. A four-time Emmy Award winner, he is the author or co-author of eleven books. He lives in New York City.Speculation isn't history, but it's catnip to pundits and journalists like veteran CBS News reporter and commentator Greenfield (The Real Campaign), who can be excused for this romp into what ifs. He rightly says that alternative history's foundation is plausibility. And since he's read widely in the sources, his excursions into possible histories are decently anchored to the ground. In the first narrative, an actual failed attempt to assassinate JFK before his inauguration instead succeeds. LBJ takes his place, Guant�namo is wiped out by a rogue Soviet missile, and war with the U.S.S.R. is only narrowly averted. In the second narrative, Robert Kennedy isn't assassinated, beats Nixon in 1968, winds down the Vietnam War, and with no Watergate scandal, the cultural changes of the 1970s are averted. The third account has Ford winning re-election, but in 1980 it's Hart vs. Reagan, and Hart wins. Of course, there are other possible scenarios, which Greenfield doesn't discuss. And in these novelistic narratives, readers drown in excess, irrelevant detail (dinner menus, precise times of meetings, exact conversations)&#x2014;all wonkish pundit stuff, and none essential to Greenfield's purpose. In the end, fun but insubstantial. (Mar.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC. All rights reserved.</p><h2>Barmy British Empire (Horrible Histories)</h2><p>It&#39;s history with the nasty bits left in!

The only promise: &#34;A medal and a body bag.&#34; What followed was a .50 caliber round in the chest and a life spent with America&#39;s elite forces bringing down warlords and war criminals, despots, and dictators. In Colombia, his task force hunted the notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar. In Panama, he helped capture the brutal dictator Manuel Noriega, liberating a nation. From Vietnam to Iran to Mogadishu, Lt.

Those were the days, author Steven Poses suggests in his foreword, when you could graduate from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in sociology, put in some time in the Peace Corps and the antiwar movement, work your way up from busboy to sous chef in a mainstream French restaurant and, with a copy of Jane Jacob's <i>Death and Life of Great American Cities</i> tucked under one arm and a total investment of $35,000, open a restaurant all your own in Philadelphia. Such was the success of Frog, its eclectic menu reaching out to many a flavor-starved palate, that seven years later Poses could reopen with a $1 million budget and expand into other restaurant ventures. <p> <i>The Frog Commissary Cookbook</i> rises out of the experience of Poses's restaurants and catering business. It's not an easy collection to finger, to size up and categorize with a single swipe of the pen. And that makes for some exciting page turning. This would be a good book to have on the shelf and open when you simply don't know what to do or what you are looking for. </p> <p> You'll find goodies like Bourbon Pecans (this "Hors d'Oeuvres" section ends with 25 quick ideas; the same is true of the "Salads" and "Pizzas" sections), Chicken in Romaine Leaves with Lime Hot Sauce, Corn and Clam Chowder, a plethora of creative salads and dressings, Seafood Stew with Aioli, Stir-fried Duck with Chinese Sausage, Italian Scrambled Eggs with Asparagus and Prosciutto, and Pumpkin Waffles. This book is all over the place, leaving a trail of deliciousness in its wake.</p> <p> According to Poses, exemplary care was taken to work out the recipes in an apartment kitchen and not on a professional stove. While all the recipes have proved popular over the years in Poses's restaurants, they were all written from scratch for the home cook. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Over 100,000 copies in print!

It is a comprehensive study on the subject. It was compiled over some ten years, from information obtained from contemporary manuscripts, books and models in the archives of the National Maritime Museum.</p><p></p><h2>The cylinder musical box handbook</h2><p>The fascination of musical boxes is such that more and more people have begun collecting these historic, delicate and beautiful instruments. Answering a real need, Graham Webb&#39;s book gives advice on how to choose them, and is illustrated with his own photographs of fine specimens. A useful list of manufacturers also helps one&#39;s choice. However, musical boxes often need some attention before their best performance is brought out, and giving them to a professional may mean a long wait. The Cylinder Musical-Box Handbook is prepared primarily for the enthusiast who want to restore to working order the boxes he has had the luck to find. A large number of clear and detailed line drawings and photographs, together with a comprehensive text, gives all the steps in cleaning a movement, restoring a case, making minor adjustments and repairs, repinning a cylinder, replacing broken teeth and tips, and redampering a comb. Cylinder musical boxes that need little attention can be set right if their owner turns to the appropriate section of the appropriate chapter; but if a box needs a thorough overhaul, the whole job can be done at home by following this handbook. The author recommends tools and replacement parts readily accessible to the layman; in the rare cases where this is not possible he has advised where to obtain them.</p><p></p><h2>Fierce Fairytales</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>T.E. Lawrence in War and Peace: An Anthology of the Military Writings of Lawrence of Arabia</h2><p>The writings presented in this volume shed tremendous light, both on the character of T. E. Lawrence and the current situation in the Middle East. Despite being written more than seventy years ago, the thoughts of Lawrence of Arabia remain remarkably pertinent. This collection includes Lawrence&#39;s wartime reports from the desert, along with later writings in which Lawrence attempts to cope with the consequences of war in the circumstances of peace. Many of the pieces have previously only been issued in limited editions. T. E. Lawrence in War and Peace is an invaluable companion volume to Seven Pillars of Wisdom, which offers a self-portrait of its author long before he became an international celebrity. It gives us the man before the myth, writing fluently, vividly and with a total command of his subject. This edition has been compiled by the acclaimed writer Malcolm Brown, who is the co-author of A Touch of Genius: The Life of T. E. Lawrence and edited The Letters of T. E. Lawrence. The publication coincides with the 70th anniversary of Lawrence&#39;s death in May 1935 and an exhibition at the Imperial War Museum, which Brown curates.</p><p>Malcolm Brown is a freelance historian at the Imperial War Museum and the editor of T.

But Tilly can still see him, even when he puts a cardboard box over his head or lies upside down behind a potted plant. All of Tumpty&#x2019;s friends find his antics very funny . . . but wait! Where did Tumpty go?</p><p>Polly Dunbar is the author-illustrator of DOG BLUE and PENGUIN (which was short-listed for a Kate Greenaway Medal) and the illustrator of SHOE BABY by Joyce Dunbar, HERE&#39;S A LITTLE POEM by Jane Yolen and Andrew Fusek Peters, and MY DAD&#39;S A BIRDMAN by David Almond. She lives in Brighton, England.PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2014;After several unsuccessful attempts at hiding, Tumpty the elephant is able to trick his friends into thinking he has disappeared. They search the house high and low, and he finally appears after being enticed by cookies and declarations of concern. There are many amusing situations involving Tilly, a little girl, and her animal friends. The characters appear in the prologue in the yellow house they share and are introduced one by one in the following scenes. Not all of the action takes place in the foreground. There is a doorway in the top corner that the animals peek in and out of. It also serves as a foreshadowing device. Text is placed above the character that is speaking and is a larger size. The background consists of a variety of muted tones, which contrast with the brighter mixed-media drawings. The illustrations are whimsical and detailed. Most of the characters have rosy cheeks and wear different patterns, and their emotions are readily apparent. At one point, the pig laughs so hard he is crying, and the chicken falls on her back in a fit of giggles. Tumpty is comedic without realizing it. His antics are similar to those in Mo Willems's "Elephant &amp; Piggie" series (Hyperion). Young children and beginning readers are sure to gravitate to this delightful story that celebrates the joy of friendship.&#x2014;<i>Lori A.

The present volume, an introduction to that literature, is at once a condensation, a reorganization, and an extension (to A.D. 1500) of <i>Japanese Court Poetry</i> (1961), by the author and Robert H. Brower, the standard treatment of the subject is in English. The book's five central chapters are devoted to the major court poets and their work; other chapters deal with the forms, assumptions, and themes of court poetry. The author's emphasis throughout is on the human and cultural values of this poetic tradition. Over 150 poems are included in both transliteration and translation. Many of the translations are joint efforts with Professor Bower; others are new translations by the author. The approach to the poems is essentially critical, and draws on the findings of recent Japanese scholarship.</p><p>Earl Miner is Professor of English at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author and editor of several books on Japanese, English, and comparative literature.</p><h2>The World Before</h2><p>In 1971, Arthur Ford gave Ruth Montgomery six predictions, published in A World Beyond.

The World Before forecasts things to come, among them:<br>-- A solution to the world's energy problem...<br>-- A reduction in crime throughout America...<br>-- The rise of a new national leader -- in Germany...<br><br>The World Before -- the dramatic and exciting book that will capture the imagination of everyone who seeks a deeper understanding of the mysteries of life.</p><p>I love these Ruth Montgomery in which she channels through automatic writing the comments of her companions from the Other Side. This time she and they reveal the past and future secrets of the planet Earth. I like how she combines her belief and skepticism. She takes their dictation on stories and then later checks the facts. She was a cynical Washington columnist and became a believer in the paranormal. This book covers the story of Creation and the fabulous lost worlds of Atlantis and Mu and even the past lives of Jackie Kennedy Onassis, Johnny Carson, Richard Nixon, Barbara Walters, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, etc. Dramatic and exciting reading.<br><br>M.

Dawkins weighs in on topics as diverse as ape rights, jury trials, religion, and education, all examined through the lens of natural selection and evolution. Although many of these essays have been published elsewhere, this book is something of a greatest-hits compilation, reprinting many of Dawkins' most famous recent compositions. They are well worth re-reading. His 1998 review of Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont's <i>Fashionable Nonsense</i> is as bracing an indictment of academic obscurantism as the book it covered, although the review reveals some of Dawkins' personal biases as well. Several essays are devoted to skillfully debunking religion and mysticism, and these are likely to raise the hackles of even casual believers. Science, and more specifically evolutionary science, underlies each essay, giving readers a glimpse into the last several years' debates about the minutiae of natural selection. In one moving piece, Dawkins reflects on his late rival Stephen Jay Gould's <i>magnum opus</i>, <i>The Structure of Evolutionary Theory</i>, and clarifies what it was the two Darwinist heavyweights actually disagreed about. While the collection showcases Dawkins' brilliance and intellectual sparkle, it brings up as many questions as it answers. As an ever-ardent champion of science, honest discourse, and rational debate, Dawkins will obviously relish the challenge of answering them. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Richard Dawkins taught zoology at the University of California at Berkeley and at Oxford University and is now the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a position he has held since 1995. Among his previous books are The Ancestor&#x2019;s Tale, The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, Climbing Mount Improbable, Unweaving the Rainbow, and A Devil&#x2019;s Chaplain.

But could the real honors belong to an inexpensive, yet powerful pocket revolver that is only now beginning to be appreciated by historians and collectors? In this long-awaited new collector s guide, noted author George Layman tells us the true story behind these diminutive, yet devastating, weapons. Perhaps ten times as popular as the Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson combined, British Bull Dog revolvers were first introduced by Philip Webley &amp; Co., but were soon duplicated by the American gun manufacturing giant Forehand &amp; Wadsworth and countless Belgian copyists. Far from being uninteresting and identical, these pistols exist today in almost limitless variety. Learn how to identify rarities and valuable variations, including prices that should be expected for each type. Also, learn which models were carried most in the West by riverboat gamblers, soiled doves and gold miners. Even Billy the Kid might have packed one! So while the gun may have British in its name, the story is all American - and one that has remained untold until now.</p><p></p><h2>The Surnames of Ireland</h2><p>Irish surnames started to evolve in the 11th century.
